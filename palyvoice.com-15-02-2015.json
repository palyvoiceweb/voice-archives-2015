Bottles of artificially colored pink soda are delivered in the middle of classes to uncomfortable recipients. Red and pink streamers that were likely purchased for less than a dollar decorate the doors of the more spirited teachers on campus. Yes, the coming of Valentine's Day has become almost palpable as the aura of synthetically manufactured love taints the air.\r\n\r\nAs you can tell, like most Palo Alto High School students, we are wholeheartedly enlivened by the fast-approaching date of Feb. 14. Don't get us wrong, we appreciate and have even participated in the school's efforts to brighten up the campus, but we would like to pause for a moment and invite our fellow classmates to partake in an arguably worthier tradition that takes place the day before Valentine's Day: (modified) Galentine's Day.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_98708\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"350\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/Screen-Shot-2015-02-12-at-10.25.43-PM.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-98708\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/Screen-Shot-2015-02-12-at-10.25.43-PM.png\" alt=\"Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler) provides her lady friends and family with a number of sentimental gifts over a Galentine\u2019s Day brunch.

Photo courtesy of NBC.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nFor those of you who are unfamiliar with the term, Galentine's Day, as coined by \"Parks and Recreation\" character Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler), is a special day dedicated to the appreciation of female friends, coworkers, family members and strong female influences in women\u2019s lives. Stories and gifts are shared over a hearty brunch meal, and as Knope would say, it's all about \"ladies celebrating ladies.\"\r\n\r\nAs wonderful as Galentine's Day is \u2013 and believe us, it is wonderful \u2013 we'd like to broaden its sentiment and apply it to the general realm of friendship, regardless of gender: something we'd like to call Pal-entine's Day.\r\n\r\nWith the long weekend upon us, it's an especially ideal time to take your friends out to a glorious brunch excursion and shower them with gifts and appreciation. If you have sufficient time, dedication and knowledge, then you can try pulling a Knope and provide your friends with bouquets of hand-crocheted flower pens; mosaic portraits of each of them made from the crushed bottles of their favorite diet sodas; gift certificates for facials; needlepoint pillows with their faces and the leading headlines from the newspapers on the days they were born on them; and personalized 5,000 word essays of why they're all so awesome. If your gift giving skills aren\u2019t quite up to par, though, never fear \u2013 any expression of your love and affection for your friends can be more important than material gifts.\r\n\r\nUltimately, we must remember that love is never exclusive to couples. There's no need to fall into a gloomy funk or secretly hate on those who are in relationships just because it's February. So, whenever February rolls around, instead of distressing and obsessing about your romantic relationship or lack thereof, choose to obsess about the gals and pals in your life who you care about most and who will never leave your side.\r\n\r\nAs Leslie Knope, the epitome of a workaholic, once said, \"We have to remember what's important in life: friends, waffles and work. Or waffles, friends, work. But work has to come third.\" While we agree that friends vs. waffles is an eternal debate, we encourage you to get a healthy dose of both by going out with your friends for some fantastic breakfast food and finding out for yourselves, as we plan to do.\r\n\r\nThe streamers and boxes of chocolates that you purchased for Valentine's Day will fade and likely pollute our planet, but the memories you make of waffles and laughter with your gals and pals will last forever.","excerpt":"Inspired by Galentine's Day from \u201cParks and Recreation,\u201d News Editor Lizzie Chun and Staff Writer Saba Moussavian propose a Feb. 13 tradition to pause in the time of Valentine\u2019s Day love with something they'd like to call \"Pal-entine's Day.\" ","date":"2015-02-12 22:51:15","author":"Lizzie Chun","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/Screen-Shot-2015-02-12-at-10.25.43-PM.png","categories":["Opinion"],"tags":{"31764":"appreciation","38784":"breakfast","38783":"brunch","38785":"friends","38649":"friendship","38646":"galentine's day","38647":"galentines","38781":"leslie knope","8927":"opinion","38780":"palentine's day","38648":"parks and rec","34605":"parks and recreation","11509":"valentine's","11508":"valentine's day","38782":"waffles"}},{"id":98549,"title":"Liveblog: Girls&#8217; soccer vs. Homestead","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/02\/12\/liveblog-girls-soccer-vs-homestead\/","content":"Check back at 3:30 p.m. for live updates as the Palo Alto High School Girl's soccer team (14-1, 8-1) takes on Homestead (6-6-3, 2-4-3) at home.\n\n[liveblog]","excerpt":"Check back at 3:30 p.m. for live updates as the Palo Alto High School Girl's soccer team (14-1, 8-1) takes on Homestead (6-6-3, 2-4-3) at home.","date":"2015-02-12 15:26:11","author":"Maddy Jones","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/IMG_0282.jpg","categories":["Sports","Uncategorized"],"tags":{"10198":"girls soccer","9087":"Senior Night","9110":"Soccer"}},{"id":97542,"title":"Paly juniors to compete in international math contest","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/02\/11\/paly-juniors-to-compete-in-international-math-contest\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_97747\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"418\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/math_award_students2.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-97747 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/math_award_students2.jpg\" alt=\"math_award_students2\" width=\"418\" height=\"314\" \/><\/a> Juniors Andrew Lee, Kathryn Li, Allison Zhang and Eric Foster pose for a picture after placing at the National High School Mathematical Contest in Modeling.

These are the words that have been used to address how, as a society, we can hope to recover from this tragedy and prevent such an event from reoccurring.\r\n\r\nAs a community, we have struggled to find ways to offer consolation and\u00a0show support for affected loved ones and community members during this time of grieving. The teachers, administration and school board of the district all showed efforts to reach out to students and remind them of the many available resources. However, there still remains conflict among many members of the community, particularly among high school students, about how to confront an issue as sensitive as suicide. Many student Facebook users have posted statuses to communicate to their friends and peers that they are available to offer support. Others argue that the support necessary to address mental health goes far beyond anything a change in a profile picture\u00a0can offer. Some don red and black to show support for Gunn students, while others believe that such an act only serves to encourage \"copycat syndrome.\"\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_97988\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"243\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/10888512_10203570932609361_4204563316199167029_n.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-97988\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/10888512_10203570932609361_4204563316199167029_n.jpg\" alt=\"The recent death of a Gunn  senior prompted a wave of changes in profile pictures, a tactic that many students used to demonstrate support for their peers.

Photo courtesy of anonymous Facebook user.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe teens\u00a0of Palo Alto may never come to a consensus on how to show that we care about each other. The important thing, however, is to remember that we do. At the end of the day, high school, in the Silicon Valley in particular, is hard for pretty much everyone. It's hard for the jocks who labor under the stereotype of being jocks. It's hard\u00a0for the closet poets who are too ashamed to reveal their gift of written word. It's hard\u00a0for the people who are just trying to make it to graduation, when they can embrace the life that awaits outside the walls of high school.\r\n\r\nNo matter what school we go to, what grade we are in or what kind of student we are,\u00a0we all experience the ups and downs of high school. As adolescents, we all have to endure\u00a0feelings of awkwardness, unhappiness and mediocrity, whether it be in academics, after school activities, or sociability. Popular culture showed us that in order to be happy, we need to have it all \u2013 looks, brains, strength, the whole package.\r\n\r\nThe result: high school becomes a competition where we are pit against our peers, our classmates, and our friends. It doesn't matter how many parties we get invited to, because someone prettier than us or funnier than us gets invited to more. The person who\u00a0outscores us on the math test ruined the curve and screwed up our GPA, and our futures are thus ruined. The kid who plays six instruments and captains the soccer team is our\u00a0enemy, because her\u00a0accomplishments undermine everything we think we should be proud of about ourselves. In this system, we are forced to stay afloat by drowning the people we should be turning to for support.\r\n\r\nWe are all subjects of a strenuous system, and for that reason, we should serve as a support system for one another. It's time we show compassion for our classmates that we never talk to because they are too weird, or too popular, or simply too different. It's time\u00a0for us to stop resenting the people who are smarter than us, or more athletic, or more musical or more talented in every way. It's time to forge bonds with the people high school turned against us. It's time to create a sense of unity in which all students feel accepted and appreciated by their peers. It's time for us to mean it when we say \"We Are All In This Together.\"\r\n\r\nThe student who outscored you on the test is not your arch-nemesis, but instead a fellow victim of intense pressures created by a society that prides itself in producing top-ranking students. The girl who seems confident\u00a0all the time is also struggling with self-esteem issues created by the enigmatic hierarchy of high school popularity. The shy kid on the quad sits alone during lunch because nobody talks to him, and nobody talks to him because he is always alone.\r\n\r\nSometimes, the difficulties faced by high schoolers is caused by mental illness, a challenge beyond our reach, yet a\u00a0challenge\u00a0we must address. The only way to properly deal with mental health is through professional help, but as fellow peers we play a\u00a0role in offering emotional comfort and mutual support.\r\n\r\nHigh school hands each individual their own unique experience, but if we make solidarity, acceptance, and friendship the norms for our peer to peer relationships, we will ultimately have a hand in\u00a0making each experience a positive one. Students should perceive each other as allies during the phase of our lives that challenges\u00a0us all. It is our obligation to each other as fellow students to remember that the people we see as our competition are experiencing the same anxieties and stresses that we do, and the energy we spend begrudging each other would be better spent befriending each other.\r\n\r\nI have grown up in Palo Alto for nearly my whole life, and I love this beautiful city that I call my home. This is the place where people dream of coming to make a better life. This is the birthplace of innovation, and the heart of opportunity and free-thinking. We have so much to be proud of, yet so much potential to be better. I want Palo Alto to go down in history for its strengths, not the crippling consequences of the actions that we take to become strong.\r\n\r\nThis is a direct message to my fellow Palo Alto teenagers: I am optimistic\u00a0that each of us has the power to help make high school a happier place for everybody. I believe that if we change our attitudes about our classmates, we can serve as one another's greatest resource in helping to make it through the awkward, challenging and demanding stage that is high school. In order for such a change to occur, we must create a camaraderie among ourselves and remember that the people we encounter on a daily basis are our equals, not our enemies. With the choices we make about how we treat our peers, we can all help make high school a little less hard.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"Staff writer Hannah Nguyen addresses how, as students, we can help make high school a more positive experience.","date":"2015-02-10 17:26:04","author":"Hannah Nguyen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/10888512_10203570932609361_4204563316199167029_n.jpg","categories":["Editor's Pick","Opinion"],"tags":{"8611":"Community","37655":"mental health","9135":"suicide","37654":"support","31762":"unity"}},{"id":98500,"title":"Choir to perform soul-themed Pops Concert","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/02\/09\/choir-to-perform-soul-themed-pops-concert\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_98504\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/14138647541_ddd91b8a4a_z1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-98504\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/14138647541_ddd91b8a4a_z1.jpg\" alt=\"Paly Choirs bows at the Pops Concert 2014.
