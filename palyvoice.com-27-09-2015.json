Callan chose volleyball as her sport after growing a passion to be the best. \"It's frustrating when you see all these girls who can hit really hard and they can jump really high and you keep making mistakes,\" Callan said. \"So I started working with a private coach and I took notes of the things he said, I have a whole notebook at home. I reviewed those before every time before I play.\"[\/caption]This week, The Paly Voice sat down with freshman volleyball player Ashlyn Callan to discuss how she made varsity, how the upperclassmen treat her and of course, volleyball.\n\nThe Paly Voice: You made varsity volleyball your freshman year, congratulations. How did you prepare for your tryouts mentally and physically?\n\nAshlyn Callan: This whole summer I have been doing a bunch of different camps. I do it every summer because it's fun. The week before tryouts, I took it a little bit easier so that I could be ready. I didn't want to go all out and be sore for the first day of tryouts, because that's never good. I also went to all the open gyms.\n\nTPV: \u201cDid you expect to make varsity?\u201d\n\nAC: Not at all. The head coach Jekara Wilson invited me to varsity tryouts and that's as far as I expected to go, because it is an accomplishment to even get invited because only six freshmen were. I was so happy because it's just amazing.\n\nTPV: You said you were excited to make varsity, could you elaborate on how you felt when you were told that you were going to be on varsity volleyball?\n\nAC: So my dad came downstairs and she [Wilson]&nbsp;&nbsp;sent out an email, he came downstairs and said \u201cBad news Ash\u201d and I was like \u201cOh that\u2019s okay, next year, I guess\u201d and he said \u201cNo, look you made it\u201d and I was like \u201cWhat!\u201d.\n\nTPV: How much more competitive is varsity volleyball compared to your club [Red Rock Volleyball Club]?\n\nAC: It\u2019s similar but different at the same time. Red Rock is all about power and hard hits and digging everything and consistency, consistency. At Paly it's like they are all amazing players too, but it's more about strategy. It's different strategies. But the girls here are smarter, they are so good.\n\nTPV: Last year a current sophomore named Chelsea Fan made varsity as a freshman and the year before that Jessica Lee made varsity as a freshman, have you talked to them about tips and what it is like being a freshman. Do you feel like you have shoes to fill?\n\nAC: They are both amazing players. I haven\u2019t talked to them specifically, but I have talked to Claire Dennis who&nbsp;made it her freshman year, she has been really, really nice and supportive and really helpful to me. She congratulated me when I made the team. She texted me when we got the roster saying \u201cCongratulations, that's great. I was in your shoes a couple years ago and it was really tough but at the same time it was the best season I ever had and I hope you have the same experience I do,\" That was really nice that she would do that.\n\nTPV: What is the vibe on the team like?\n\nAC: It\u2019s really good. Coach Wilson really emphasized in tryouts that you need good chemistry as a team or else it doesn\u2019t go well, because you need communication. Volleyball is a team sport so all the girls have to be super supportive.&nbsp;Sometimes you need to yell at somebody for something they did wrong, but they do it nicely. It\u2019s good. We play well together.\n\nTPV: A lot of times freshmen don't get a lot of playing time on varsity teams. How do you feel about that? Was there ever a thought about not playing varsity and instead playing junior varsity so you could get more playing time?\n\nAC: Well I did the same thing for club. I played Red Rock and didn't get much playing time at all but you have to work for your playing time, no matter how good you are. Just by practicing with the girls, I have developed so much, that it is worth it for me to stay even if I don\u2019t play that much. It's worth it. I think we play five sets and some teams in our league aren't as good so hopefully I get to play.","excerpt":"This week, The Paly Voice sat down with Freshman volleyball player Ashlyn Callan, to discuss how she made varsity, upperclassmen, and her love for volleyball.

Photo by Adrienne Kwok.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe application deadline for Advanced Authentic Research, a program that will allow Palo Alto Unified School District high school students to showcase their applied research skills in a variety of academic subjects, is approaching on Sept. 25.\r\n\r\nAccording to AAR Coordinator Jeong Choe, students will be responsible for creating a specific thesis and researching their own\u00a0topics. Students can conduct \u00a0research on a multitude of themes, including history, psychology, business and sports.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe program is a unique opportunity for students in grades 10-12,\u201d Choe said. \u201cIt is designed for students with interest, passion, curiosity and perseverance to investigate an authentic topic of their choosing.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn addition, students will be paired with a mentor knowledgeable in the chosen area of research, according to Choe.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey [Mentors] will support and facilitate each student\u2019s work in their own laboratories, offices and other settings,\u201d Choe said. \u201cIf students are conducting surveys, they may be at another place. If students are doing computational work, the place may be flexible.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis year, students will participate in the program on their own time after school or during the weekend this year, but starting next year the program will be incorporated into a 7th Period class, according to PAUSD\u00a0Deputy Supt.\u00a0Markus Autrey.\r\n\r\nStudents will receive 10 Career Technical Education school credits for completing the program and working for a minimum of 60 hours per semester, though the scheduling is flexible. The class is pass or fail, according to Choe, and progress report will be collected from participants\u00a0in February.\r\n\r\n\u201cSome students may choose to spend more time than this based on their development of interests and passion in their research project,\u201d Choe said.\r\n\r\nWhile the program is similar to Paly\u2019s Science Research Project program, AAR is not limited to science-related topics.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can view AAR as an expansion of SRP,\u201d Choe said. \u201cSRP has a science focus and a lab component is a crucial piece. In AAR, we are giving opportunities to all the other disciplines.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Choe, students will begin researching their topics in October and finalize their findings in May.\r\n\r\nBoth Paly and Gunn High School are providing the program for its inaugural year.\r\n\r\nGunn High School AAR liaison Angela Merchant says\u00a0AAR is an excellent program for students.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are looking forward to organizing and implementing this great opportunity for kids,\u201d Merchant said.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.pausd.org\/sites\/default\/files\/pdf-faqs\/attachments\/ApplicationAAR-Fillable.pdf\">Applications<\/a> are due through an email to Choe at jchoe@pausd.org.
