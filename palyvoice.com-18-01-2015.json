Photo courtesy of Claire Liu.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nA Palo Alto High School senior was recognized as the first alternate for the U.S. Senate Youth Program and met with other finalists and representatives from the Department of Education to discuss school climate at the State Capitol this Wednesday in Sacramento.\r\n\r\nThe recognized senior was the Associated Student Body President and Campanile editor-in-chief, Claire Liu.\r\n\r\nAccording to a December <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cde.ca.gov\/nr\/ne\/yr14\/yr14rel116.asp\">press release<\/a>, students must be nominated by their high school principal to participate in the program. A selection committee later reviews the applicants and selects based on strict criteria.\r\n\r\n\u201cI went to Sacramento and had lunch with the superintendent [of the state], Tom Torlakson, the other finalists and people who worked at the Department of Education to talk about issues at public schools and the changes we can make,\u201d Liu said.\r\n\r\nDuring her visit, Liu learned about the passions of the other finalists.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was so humbled to be selected with three incredible intelligent and conscious young men,\u201d Liu said. \u201cDahkota Brown [Argonaut High School] works on an Native American issues, Benjamin Beltran [Nevada Union High School] works on the achievement gap and Dustin Chiang [Mission San Jose High School] is the two-term president of the California Distributive Education Clubs of America. I learned a lot and was inspired to sit with people like that.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt the meeting, Liu noticed the advantages that students at Paly have.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhile we were talking to the superintendent about the college guidance programs, it was so clear the advantage Paly has to other schools in the state and nation,\u201d Liu said.\r\n\r\nAccording to Liu, Paly has more resources that can help students during the college application process.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have a teacher advisor for every 20 to 30 kids, guiding them through high school whereas other schools may only have one advisor for 100 kids,\u201d Liu said.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage Paly has is the ease of access to technology, according to Liu.\r\n\r\n\u201cDustin\u2019s school didn\u2019t have enough computers to administer a standardized test,\u201d Liu said. \u201cThat made me realize we never have a problem like that.\u201d\r\n\r\nLiu said the experience made her appreciate what she has at Paly.\r\n\r\n\u201cBeing in the Associated Student Body and journalism, you look for things to change but you forget what\u2019s already around,\u201d Liu said.\r\n\r\nWhile Liu has not decided on a college yet, she has an idea of what she will pursue in the future.\r\n\r\n\u201cI'm interested in maybe studying Economics or Public Policy and going into business with a focus on corporate social responsibility, and maybe further down the road looking into government,\u201d Liu said.","excerpt":"A Palo Alto High School senior was recognized as the first alternate for the U.S. Senate Youth Program and met with other finalists and representatives <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/01\/17\/student-recognized-for-leadership-at-state-capitol\/#more-'\" class=\"more-link\">more &raquo;<\/a>","date":"2015-01-17 13:49:38","author":"Will Zhou","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/photo-1.png","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"8496":"ASB","8552":"California","14290":"claire liu","9084":"senate","36605":"youth"}},{"id":96005,"title":"College Declassified: The Interview","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/01\/15\/college-declassified-the-interview\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_96142\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"800\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/IMG_20150115_0556461.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-96142\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/IMG_20150115_0556461.jpg\" alt=\"A water bottle and r\u00e9sum\u00e9 are helpful items to to a college admissions interview.

The interview is the only opportunity for applicants to meet with college representatives in person. Photo by Hannah Nguyen.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe applications are in. The big\u00a0January deadlines have lapsed and the Class of 2015 is beginning to bask in the glory of Second-Semester-Seniority. The burdens of The Common Application, supplements, test scores and recommendations have been lifted. Time to break out the whiffle balls and put this whole \u201ccollege thing\u201d behind us, right? Well, sort of. One more key component of the application still looms ahead for many seniors: The interview.\r\n\r\nWhile it might not make or break your application, the interview is the only opportunity applicants have to meet with a representative of a college,\u00a0one-on-one, face-to-face. Forget the test scores, forget the grades. This is your chance to show your college, in person, who you really are, and what kind of student you will be. How easily do you talk to strangers? What gets \u00a0you excited? What sense of humor do you have? These are the qualities that can't be organized in lists on the Common App. At the end of the day, the only part of your application that you take with you to college is, well, you.\r\n\r\nAfter having been through the college interview process\u00a0twice\u00a0myself, and consulting peers and a Columbia University alumni who has conducted interviews in the past, I have picked up a few pointers on how to walk away from an interview feeling successful. Here are some tips on preparing for your interview, and what you can do to make your interview worthwhile.\r\n\r\n<strong>Before Your Interview:<\/strong>\r\n\r\n1. Get in contact.\r\n\r\nThe process of setting up an interview is different across schools. Some schools give your contact information to alumni, who will then get in touch with you about an interview. Other schools will provide contact information of a nearby alum, and expect you to take the initiative of setting up an interview time. Do this as soon as possible to give them the most flexibility about a time to meet with you. Give them different times that you are available, and emphasize that you can work with their schedule. Exchange phone numbers, so they have an easy way to contact you on the day of the interview.\r\n\r\n2. Do your research.\r\n\r\nYou can almost guarantee that your interviewer will ask something to the extent of \u201cWhy _____?\u201d Prepare your answer, and be sure to know which specific qualities of the school you can talk about for a good amount of time\u00a0\u2013\u00a0don\u2019t be afraid to make it personal. Do they have an award-winning marching band that you\u2019d love to join? Is it a particular study abroad program that attracts you? Do you just love to be surrounded in nature? Understand why that particular school is good for you goals and interests, and what it is about you that makes you a good fit. Have ideas in your head, but avoid reciting your answer word for word beforehand. There\u2019s a difference between sounding prepared and sounding scripted.\r\n\r\n3. Ask your own questions.\r\n\r\nYour interviewer will also serve as a resource to learn more about the school.\u00a0Use this as an opportunity to show interest and preparedness by asking specific questions about programs and activities. Don\u2019t waste time by asking things that can be found on the website, like how many clubs the school has. Ask instead why 60 percent of the students are involved Greek life and how that impacts campus culture.\r\n\r\n<strong>On the Day Of Your Interview:<\/strong>\r\n\r\n1. Bring a R\u00e9sum\u00e9.\r\n\r\nA must-have if they ask for one, a bonus if they don\u2019t. An well-organized r\u00e9sum\u00e9 says that you are\u00a0prepared and professional. Use your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to summarize the skills and experiences that you think are most important, including but not limited to work experience, community servic or athletic achievement. Not only will a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 give your interview talking points during the interview, but it will also help them remember you later, when they are writing up your evaluation.\r\n\r\n2. Dress appropriately.\r\n\r\nSelf-explanatory. You want them to imagine you as a student on their campus, so dress modestly, and go for a little formality. You're more likely to leave a good impression and show that you value your time with the interviewer if you look polished and presentable. Definitely leave the sweats and tanks at home. If you're the superstitious type, it probably wouldn't hurt to wear something with the school's color.\r\n\r\n3. Bring sustenance.\r\n\r\nIf you are at a caf\u00e9, the nice interviewers will ask if you would like to get something to drink before you start your interview. Saying yes will not make you annoying, it will make you human. Come prepared with a water bottle just in case. Talking for 20 straight minutes will inevitably make you thirsty, and having something to drink could be a game-changer in how articulately you deliver your answers. The interviewer will think nothing less of you if you need to take a sip of water between questions.\r\n\r\n4. Be punctual.\r\n\r\nIf you make your interviewer wait extended amounts of time for you, there\u2019s very little you can say to convince them that you are responsible, organized or deserving of a place at their school. Plan ahead, and if you\u2019re meeting in a public place like a caf\u00e9, arrive before them to secure a table. Shoot them a text to let them know where you are and what color you are wearing, so they don\u2019t have to search the room to determine which 18-year-old is their interviewee.\r\n\r\n5. Relax. You are not on trial.\r\n\r\nTake your time to understand each question, and figure out the best way to answer it. Think about what you are going to say before you say it, so you don\u2019t end up blurting out a nonsensical string of \u201clike's\u201d and \"um's.\" Avoid\u00a0simple \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d responses to keep it conversational.\r\n\r\n6. Be Yourself.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, your college interviewer isn\u2019t trying to grill you or intimidate you. They are trying to understand what kind of person you are, and if you are a good fit for their school. Speak passionately about the things that are important to you, and answer honestly about how you have confronted challenges in your life. Say what you truly think, not what you think they want to hear.\r\n\r\n7. Anything else?\r\n\r\nThere will come a point in the interview when the rep will ask if there's anything else that the college should know about you.\u00a0Don't be shy about this one. You have spent the last 18 or so years of your life doing and thinking things that make you a unique person, and colleges should know why it is you are who you are. Reiterate the points you have already discussed if you deem them significant qualities, and add in anything else about you that is pertinent that hasn't come up yet. Maybe it's that you have a baby sister who has taught you the duties of responsibility. Maybe it's a charming anecdote about an embarrassing moment that taught you a lesson in humility. Maybe it's a statement about how despite all of the strong applications they are receiving, you are the best candidate there is because nobody else in the world can do exactly what you do. Leave them with something to remember.\r\n\r\n<strong>After the interview:<\/strong>\r\n\r\nShow your gratitude.\r\n\r\nBe sure to thank your interviewer after your interview is complete. It probably wouldn\u2019t hurt to send an email as well, to thank them for their time.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"Your applications may be in, but there's one more missing piece.

There will be a mic, mood lighting, beanbag chairs and a caf\u00e9 type feel, with coffee, hot chocolate and baked goods for sale.\r\n\r\nThose interested in performing a poem should contact Eberhart or Stewart at teenartscouncil@gmail.com or message them on Facebook and include their name and title of poem if available. There will also be poems provided at the event for anyone who wants to read them. Any type of poetry is welcome, and poems do not have to be memorized.\r\n\r\n\"There are almost no restrictions for the types of poems that can be performed,\" Eberhart said. \"I\u00a0hope for a wide range of classic, published poems by poetry sages to inspiring, original poems by the students of the Bay Area \u2013 anything from haikus to free verse to odes.\"\r\n\r\nThe idea for the event came about when Eberhart and Stewart, who are both passionate about poetry, noticed an absence of a place to express and share a love for poetry.\r\n\r\n\"I've been faced with several people who share the same kind of love for poems that I do,\" Eberhart said. \"I strongly believe that teenagers have the most creative minds and write beautifully, but are often discouraged by the mindset that it's kinda dorky. And for some reason, there had been no real medium besides the paper or the online publisher for sharing poetry. Besides standing idly by, I decided to take action and really make it happen.\"\r\n\r\nThe title of the event, \"Point B: Teen Poetry Jam,\" has special meaning to both Eberhart and Stewart.\r\n\r\n\"Point B is Claire's and my favorite poem by Sarah Kay, who writes slam poetry,\" Stewart said. \"And it's where we connected and found our shared love of poetry. It also means that our poetry jam will hopefully be people's Point B, or a place that they can always go to without hesitation. It's another way of us promoting our idea of a family of poetry lovers, new and old.\"\r\n\r\nEberhart and Stewart hope that there will be many more poetry jams in the future.\r\n\r\n\"We hope to continue Point B throughout our high school years,\" Stewart said. \"And we also hope to host four events a year, kind of like a seasonal thing: one in summer, one in fall, one in winter and one in spring.\"","excerpt":"Teen Arts Council's first Poetry Jam will be held from 7 to 9 p.m. this Friday, Jan. 16, at the Palo Alto Children's Theater.

The sitcom features Leslie Knope (Amy\u00a0Poehler), an enthusiastic city employee in small town Pawnee, Ind. Some of the funniest moments of the show are based on extreme character traits such as the irony of Ron Swanson\u2019s (Nick Offerman) extreme libertarian and anti-government political views despite working for the government. We suggest watching the previous seasons on Netflix or Hulu+ before watching the premiere to fully understand the humor. The new season plans to bring back minor characters such as orthodontist and city councilman Jeremy Jamm (Jon Glaser) and Tammy II Swanson (Megan Mullally), Ron\u2019s manipulative ex-wife. Grab some JJ\u2019s Diner style waffles and tune in.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_95459\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"294\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/galavant.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-95459\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/galavant.jpg\" alt=\"New show Galavant airs sundays on ABC.

Photo: ABC.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nSundays on the American Broadcasting Company feature the quirky musical-comedy \"Galavant.\" The self-proclaimed \u201ccomedy extravaganza\u201d includes the talent of Timothy Omundson, known for his role as Carlton Lassiter in the hit-show \"Psych,\"\u00a0stealing the spotlight as the evil king. \"Galavant\" could be described as the musical mix between \"Robin Hood: Men in Tights,\"\u00a0\"The Princess Bride\" and \"Monty Python.\" Ridiculous, yes. Fun and entertaining, also yes. It tells the story of Galavant (Joshua Sasse), your typical dashing hero and his adventure to rescue his one true love, Madalena (Mallory Jansen), from the evil king, only to find that his fair maiden doesn\u2019t want to be saved. Obviously what ensues is a racing enterprise\u00a0to win her back, filled with ridiculous comedy and equally ridiculous musical numbers. Composer Alan Menken (\"Little Shop of Horrors,\" \"The Little Mermaid,\" and \"Beauty and the Beast\") and lyricist Glenn Slater (who previously collaborated with Menken in \"Tangled\") deliver in the musical aspect with one ambitious and cleverly worded song after another. There is nothing quite like it, a musical medieval sitcom that is definitely worth checking out.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_95469\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"297\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/chris-soules.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-95469\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/chris-soules.jpg\" alt=\"The Bachelor returns to the screen.

The new season took off with its classic three hour premiere . However, this year the producers decided to change it up a bit and host the first live show in the 18-season history of \"The Bachelor.\" Chris Soules, a.k.a \u201cPrince Farming\u201d and a fan favorite during Andi Dorfman's season, returns as the new bachelor. Soules is charming, rustic, humble and the perfect new lead for this reality \u201cromance.\" Over the course of the eventful three-hour episode, Soules kisses a contestant, meets two widows and even calls a time out from the rose-giving to rethink things. Bachelor fans everywhere are in for a treat as there will be more backstabbing, fighting, tears\u00a0and, as always, a slew of broken hearts, all part of the drama that quite honestly makes the show worth watching.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_95421\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/680.16x9.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-95421\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/680.16x9.jpg\" alt=\"New ABC show, Agent Carter airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m.\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" \/><\/a> New ABC show, Agent Carter airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. Photo: ABC.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAt 9 p.m. on Tuesdays, ABC plans to take viewers to 1946 New York in Marvel\u2019s \"Agent Carter.\" As soldiers return home from World War II, Agent Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) deals with the sexism that has been brought upon by peace and finds herself doing menial work. Carter works for the Secret Scientific Reserve, an American intelligence agency. This superhero tale gone TV is perfect for those who cannot get enough of Marvel comic books and movies. The show is not only appealing to superhero lovers, but its \u201cGirl Power\u201d attitude also attracts a separate audience. The pilot has already aired but can be viewed through <a title=\"ABC\" href=\"http:\/\/abc.go.com\/shows\/marvels-agent-carter\">ABC<\/a>\u00a0 and <a title=\"Hulu\" href=\"http:\/\/www.hulu.com\/marvels-agent-carter\">Hulu<\/a>.

Jerry Brown in September 2014.\r\n\r\nAccording to Foothill's Dental Hygiene Program Director Phyllis Spragge, if Foothill is one of the 15 community colleges chosen to offer a bachelor's degree program, administrators will create their first four-year dental hygiene program. Andrea Hanstein, Foothill director of marketing and public relations, said Foothill would implement this pilot program by 2016.\r\n\r\nThe state chancellor\u2019s office will judge the colleges\u2019 proposals and consult with UC and CSU schools to decide the chosen 15 community colleges. According to California's Legislative Counsel, the accepted colleges will only initially be able to offer one program, which will have to pass through the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges and find a method of payment for the program.\r\n\r\nAccording to Palo Alto High School college advisor Sandra Cernobori, on average, 12 to 15 percent of Paly seniors apply to Foothill each year. If created, the dental hygiene program would provide Paly graduates the opportunity to enroll in a baccalaureate degree at Foothill for the first time.\r\n\r\nSenior Grete Saue is planning to go to Foothill and would consider\u00a0the new program.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think it's a good idea,\u201d Saue said. \u201cIt opens up new opportunities for people who may not have the money, want to stay local or even need to spend the extra money that universities require.\u201d\r\n\r\nCurrently no UC or CSU university teaches dental hygiene, and the course is only available through three private universities in California. The cost of tuition for the program at these private colleges ranges from $43,000 to $70,000 per year. If Foothill is granted the opportunity to create this program, it will be offered at rates significantly lower than those of private universities, according to Spragge.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe tuition for the pilot program baccalaureate degree programs will be higher than the usual community college fees, but lower than CSU or UC fees,\u201d Spragge said. \u201cIt is estimated that a bachelor\u2019s degree under this pilot program could cost about $10,000.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Spragge, Foothill chose the dental hygiene program due to the vitality of dental hygiene in the job market, the need for dental hygiene care in California and the strength of Foothill\u2019s current dental hygiene program. According to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.foothill.edu\/bio\/programs\/dentalh\/\">Foothill College\u2019s website<\/a>, its dental hygiene program has led to consistent rankings as one of the top 10 community colleges in the United States for dental hygiene. Its website says that its current two-year dental hygiene program includes curriculum that covers the basic sciences, oral anatomy, public health, nutrition, clinical dental hygiene, periodontics and radiology.\r\n\r\nAn average of 100 students apply each year for 24 spots in the current program, according to Spragge. However, the competition for a spot in the program would be lessened with the addition of a four-year program.\r\n\r\n\"Even though we only take 24 students a year, we're looking at this bachelor degree program to be larger in number and in scope,\" Spragge said.\r\n\r\nThe employment rate in the dental hygiene field is presumed to grow by 38 percent through 2020, significantly faster than other occupations, according to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bls.gov\/oes\/current\/oes292021.htm\">U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics<\/a>. This growth is attributed to an increased demand for dental care and a greater use of dental hygienists.\r\n\r\nFor more information about Foothill's current dental hygiene program, you can visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.foothill.edu\/bio\/programs\/dentalh\/\">Foothill's official site<\/a>.","excerpt":"Foothill College is one of dozens of community colleges striving to introduce a low-cost bachelor degree program as an affordable alternative to those that traditional California Public Universities offer.","date":"2015-01-13 21:44:12","author":"Adele Bloch","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/unnamed.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"34667":"bachelor degree program","8552":"California","34668":"community college","34669":"Foothill","8715":"Foothill College"}}]
