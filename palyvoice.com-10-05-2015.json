The showcase highlights versatile student talent in acting, directing and playwriting and the diverse lineup of plays presented make for a fun and engaging evening of theater.\n\n\"One Acts\" is the theatre department's final showcase of the year, and while it lacks the grandeur of full-length productions, the showcase allows for heavy student involvement, specifically in directing and writing. The night features five one-act plays, all of which are entirely student directed, including a student original, \"The Sphinx,\" written by senior Guive Assadi.\n\nThe night starts off with \"The Marriage Proposal,\" written by the acclaimed Anton Chekhov and directed by senior Katherine Craig. In it, a man named Ivan, played by freshman Sam Kim, has his marriage proposal to Natalyia, played by senior Riley Cassidy, go horribly wrong due to comical miscommunications. Sophomore Joelle Dong's character acts as both the mother of Natalyia and as the mediator between Natalyia and Ivan. The play features excellent control of difficult language by all three actors, a tribute to the directorial work of Craig, as well as skillful comedic timing by Dong as the mother. While the pace of the play feels a bit rushed at times, the show starts off \"One Acts\" in an exciting fashion.\n\nThe next play is \"The Auditioners,\" written by Doug Rand, and co-directed by senior Hannah Nguyen and junior Sophie Swezey. The play follows no structured plot. Instead, it features a collection of comical monologues presented to a panel of stern casting directors. The play includes 17&nbsp;actors, by far the largest cast in \"One Acts\", each of whom contribute something unique. Particular standouts include freshman Alexandra Dinu as Auditioner #1, sophomore Chayenne Greenburg as Auditioner #3 and sophomore Jackson Kienitz as Auditioner #10. While the play was well-directed, it feels a bit too long for \"One Acts,\" and could have been easily been trimmed slightly.\n\nThe next play is an adaptation of \"No Exit,\" written by French playwright Jean-Paul Sartre and directed by senior Sabrina Sonner. The only drama of the night, the plot revolves around three characters: a man named Cradeau, played by Assadi, and two women named Inez and Estelle, played by junior Clara Baker and sophomore Claire Eberhart, respectively. The premise is that their&nbsp;afterlives involve being locked in a room with each other for the rest of eternity. All three actors develop a unique sense of character, and the conflict between Baker and Eberhart's characters is both compelling and effective. While the actors all did a fantastic job, the best aspect of the show is the staging, as it significantly added to the drama of the performance.\n\n\"The Actor's Nightmare\" is the fourth and final adapted script of the evening, written by Christopher Durang and directed by sophomore Jason Pollak.&nbsp;<span style=\"color: #000000;\"> The protagonist, George, played by sophomore Joey Kellison-Lin, is a man who is unwillingly pushed onto the stage to perform plays such as&nbsp;\u201cHamlet\u201d and \u201cPrivate Lives.\" His inexperience leads him to do<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">&nbsp;ridiculous things such as slapping his scene partners, sitting in trash cans, and taking off his pants on the middle of the stage.&nbsp;<\/span>\n\nThe play leaves a strong impression, as the comedic display is phenomenal. Kellison-Lin's performance as George is both convincing and hilarious and the show as a whole perfectly fits the atmosphere of \"One Acts.\"\n\nThe last play of the night is \"The Sphinx,\" written by Assadi and directed by senior Oskar Soderberg. A mysterious figure named \"The Sphinx,\" played by junior Zoe Limbrick, comes into a high school student's bedroom and threatens to eat the student's paper unless she completes three tasks. Assadi's comedic writing along with Soderberg's direction helps bring this absurdist tale to life, and effectively ends One Acts on a slightly ridiculous note. While Assadi's script does have a couple jokes that maybe not everybody would understand, the creative original script is the perfect way to end an entertaining evening.\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">The variety of the plays and the versatility of the Paly Theatre students in \"One Acts\" are impressive and speak to the strength of the department. While \"One Acts\" this year runs fairly long, the various plays are must-sees.<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">\"One Acts\" will play again at 7:30 p.m. tonight in the Haymarket Theater. Tickets cost $5 for students and seniors, and $10 for adults.<\/span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"After two successful performances, the Palo Alto High School Theatre department's \"One Acts\" has it's final performance tonight at 7:30 p.m. in the Haymarket Theatre.

Palo Alto High School's robotics team, however, breaks\u00a0this stereotype, having an\u00a0art team that has been working hard throughout the year, designing graphics, winning the\u00a0Underground Society of Animator's competition in April and hosting animation classes for students.\r\n\r\nTo some students, it may come as a surprise to learn that the robotics team has an art division.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Team 8 [Paly] Robotics Team has\u00a0the traditional teams you would think of when working on a robot: like programming and building,\u201d art team member and junior Peter Turnbull said. \u201cHowever, we also have the art team.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis year, especially, the art team\u2019s importance and responsibilities has grown within Team 8.\r\n\r\n\u201cI expanded\u00a0the animation team to a whole art division,\u201d senior and art team captain Griffin Bajor said. \u201cThe graphic design team creates things like posters, shirts, and flags to make us [the robotics team] look as professional as possible; the sketching and storytelling team brainstorms the ideas, and creates the storyboards for the animators to use; [and] the animation team creates full 3D animation to model.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn addition to animating and designing, members of the art team also have the chance to hone a wide range of skills.\r\n\r\n\u201cOur role as the art team is to attract creative individuals across Paly and give them a place to use their skills to add to robotics, or too learn new completely skills,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cThese artists become exposed to the engineering minds [and] a very real-world work environment for an amazing experience for everyone. Students can range from having no experience at all to being masters of their craft.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis season, the team worked on an entry for the Underground Society Animator\u2019s competition.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe USA Competition was our focus from January to April,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cThe idea is that all the teams competing receive the same narrative prompt, and they have to accomplish it in a short animation. We were challenged to somehow, \u2018Tell the story of an insect that somehow causes the robot uprising\u2019, in 1 minute.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor their entry, the team<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=djbOAmS1TRM&amp;list=PL2U4HKGu4qvGfu_ycvxPobJu4MTWp6CAl&amp;index=2\"> created an animation<\/a> about an ant that was training for a marathon, according to Turnbull.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe won the Technical Award, which is\u00a0first place, and a $1000 prize, \"\u00a0 Turnbull said. \"It was a very bumpy road, filled with procrastination and cutting scenes that we didn't expect to,\u00a0but I am incredibly proud of the work that everyone on the team put in, and I'm so happy to be a part of this team. Winning feels pretty good.\"\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_103250\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"556\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015_USA_Award_Team_0008_TECHNICAL_AWARD.gif\"><img class=\"wp-image-103250\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015_USA_Award_Team_0008_TECHNICAL_AWARD.gif\" alt=\"2015_USA_Award_Team_0008_TECHNICAL_AWARD\" width=\"556\" height=\"313\" \/><\/a> The\u00a0art team\u00a0created an animation about an ant training for a marathon for the USA competition. \"To us this animation hit every note,\" the judges said. \"It had well done character animation, nice use of lighting and textures, and it had a cohesive story. Well done team.\" Video Courtesy of Paly Robotics.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nMoving forward, the entire robotics team is transitioning into new leadership roles, while the animation team will also be teaching animation classes.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are in the process of\u00a0training members and working on our recruitment and intake process for next year,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cArt team specifically, we are teaching two mini-classes for animation. The Intro class [started last week with] robotics members, [and] some from outside the robotics team, and the Advanced Animation class \u00a0starts after the Intro class ends.\r\n\r\nThe team is looking forward to next year and using the experience it has gained this year to improve.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe learned so much from this latest animation, \u201d Bajor said. \u201cI can't wait to see for next year's competition. We made something that was great, and it's incredibly important that each of us in the team remember that. There will be more competitions to compete in, more poster to make, webcomics to draw and so much more. Next year is going to be fantastic.\u201d","excerpt":"When people think of robotics, they think of math, science, and computers, not art.

The boys have become a much deeper team, which bodes well for their championship meets.\r\n\r\n\u201cSome of our guys to watch for in the next weeks are sophomores Ethan Bundy and Alex Liang, juniors Andrew Cho, Matthew Liang, Robert Cheng and Daniel Sing and seniors Oliver Tucher, William Shin, Winston Wang and Ryan Drover,\u201d Drover said.\r\n\r\nIn addition, senior and captain for girls' swimming, Sarah Putulin, is proud that the girls' are going into league championships undefeated.\r\n\r\n\u201cI'm so proud of the girls for what they've accomplished and I can't wait to see them swim really fast at at Leagues [Championships] and CCS [Central Coast Sectionals],\u201d Putulin said.\r\n\r\nAs many girls on the swim team have begun tapering, Putulin is excited for the time drops that are likely to come with it.\r\n\r\n\u201cI'm very confident that we'll win Leagues [Championships] and that we'll place top 5 at CCS, \" Putulin said. \u201cWe have the talent and the depth to pull through.
