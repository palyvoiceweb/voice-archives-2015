Are you tired of traditional social media sites? If so, Stanford alumni and founders of the social app Spindle, Alex Walker and Amanda Lin, may have a solution for you. The two\u00a0visited The Paly Voice last week\u00a0to talk about <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/spindle-tell-it-like-it-is\/id970237649?mt=8\">Spindle<\/a> and its goal of\u00a0being a \u201cselfish app.\"\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although at first glance, Spindle may seem to resemble\u00a0other social apps\u00a0like\u00a0Instagram and Twitter, its overarching goals are\u00a0different.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cA lot of current social media revolve around people creating an image of themselves,\u201d Lin said. \u201cWe wanted people to have a space to allow them to be\u00a0<\/span>themselves and document their lives. [Spindle\u2019s like a personal] journal, that also allows people to share certain entries.\u201d\r\n\r\nThrough their application, Walker and Lin seek to emulate real life conversations and discussions.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn life, people have different friend groups,\" Lin said. \u201cSomething you share with one group might not be what you want to share with another. With Spindle, you get to choose what to share with each group. There\u2019s no friending on Spindle and the recipient of every entry, [if you choose to share it,] is dependent on you.\u201d\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Walker and Lin founded Spindle after meeting\u00a0at Stanford University. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe went to Stanford together and graduated in 2013,\u201d Walker said. \u201cWe became really good friends in freshmen year and started Spindle when we graduated. Stanford taught us that it was okay to go for something since the people around you are constantly taking these risks. You\u2019re taught that anything is possible. Together, we\u2019ve been working on this for a little over\u00a0nine months.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Lin, she and Walker used their experience with product design, computer science, symbolic systems and design to build their app from scratch.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_110995\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"603\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/screen-shot-2015-09-03-at-11-30-27-pm.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-110995\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/screen-shot-2015-09-03-at-11-30-27-pm.png\" alt=\"screen-shot-2015-09-03-at-11-30-27-pm\" width=\"603\" height=\"390\" \/><\/a> Spindle co-founder Amanda Lin's joy at climbing to the top of Half Dome turned into fear when she thought she would fall off when jumping for a photo. According to Walker, this photo captures the essence of Spindle. \"We want to give people a way to save the best stuff and time travel back to it later,\" Lin said. Photo courtesy of Amanda Lin.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA typical Spindle can be short, but users can group them together to create a story.\u00a0The application\u00a0acts as a journal for important life moments.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cMy proudest Spindle is [my story] of when I ran a half marathon,\u201d Lin said. \u201cI\u2019m not a runner and I\u00a0hate running, but I challenged myself. I tracked my practice runs, the events leading up to the weekend and the race itself.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Walker, Spindle also allows you to see the days\u00a0during which you saved the most highlights.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\"Spindle only saves the [what you deem as] highlights,\" Lin said. \"With texts [or social media], there\u2019s a whole lot of other stuff. Spindle saves the best of the best, happiest and saddest stories.\u201d\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The inspiration for Spindle came from Walker and Lin\u2019s desire to remember the little moments in life. <\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are both storytellers,\u201d Walker said. \u201cOften times, the stories you want to share aren't big events. We want to give people a way to save the best stuff and time travel back to it later.\u201d\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The idea of storytelling is woven into Spindle's name.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt [Spindle] sounds really fun, but also ties a bunch of threads together,\u201d Walker said.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n<\/span>\r\n\r\nWalker and Lin have high hopes for the future of Spindle.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe want to be a brand synonymous with how people document their lives,\u201d Walker said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_111319\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"199\"]<img class=\"wp-image-111319\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/12179926_751188174986733_1693898061_n.jpg\" alt=\"12179926_751188174986733_1693898061_n\" width=\"199\" height=\"354\" \/> Screenshot from the app by Adele Bloch.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"Do you want to journal your life?

The initial plan\u2019s goal was to expand bicycle and pedestrian commuting trips and to promote healthy lifestyles by creating bicycle-friendly infrastructure, according to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cityofpaloalto.org\/news\/displaynews.asp?NewsID=499&amp;TargetID=107\">City of Palo Alto Website<\/a>. These recent plans are an extension of the 2012 plan.\r\n\r\nImplementing these plans are not easy and will create some complications, according to Mello.\r\n\r\n\u201cSome challenges that we are facing is preserving as much of the improved landscaping on the Paly property as possible, working effectively with Caltrain and the California Public Utilities Commission on the railroad crossing improvements and reaching consensus with the community on any proposed modifications to on-street parking or travel lane width,\u201d Mello said.\r\n\r\nMello encourages any students who are interested in helping develop the concept plans to contact him at <a href=\"mailto:Joshuah.Mello@cityofpaloalto.org\">Joshuah.Mello@cityofpaloalto.org<\/a>.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe will be more than happy to review the initial concept plans with any interested students and incorporate their feedback into the design,\u201d Mello said. \u201cI also hope that students will help get the word out and notify anyone that they know who may be interested in this project, including their parents or neighbors. The more we hear from the public, the better the final design will be.\u201d","excerpt":"The City of Palo Alto plans to implement improvements to its city roads, some of which will affect Palo Alto High School student commuters.","date":"2015-11-02 19:20:28","author":"Adrienne Kwok","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/DSCN2300.jpg","categories":["Features","Spotlight"],"tags":["alma","bicycle","caltrain","castilleja","churchill","city","crosswalk","el camino","el camino real","elevated","Improvement","infrastructure","intersection","joshuah","Madrono","mello","pedestrian","Sarah","sidewalk","stoplight","syed"]}]
