While Zero Period PE is not responsible for a large percentage of these numbers, running the mile at 7:15 a.m. is sure to drain already sleep-deprived youth and can lead to even greater health risks. According to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.apa.org\/monitor\/oct01\/sleepteen.aspx\">American Psychological Association<\/a>, research suggests that sleep deprivation puts adolescents at risk for cognitive and emotional difficulties, poor school performance, accidents and psychopathology.\r\n\r\nSleep deprivation can lead to other negative side effects. It\u00a0can cause aggressive behavior and contribute to illnesses, according to the Sleep Foundation. According to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aap.org\/en-us\/about-the-aap\/aap-press-room\/aap-press-room-media-center\/Pages\/Sleepy-Teens.aspx\">American Academy of Pediatrics<\/a>, the risk of depression significantly increased among teens who sleep less than eight hours a night. While one may state that students enrolled in Zero Period PE try to sleep earlier in compensation, no surveys or studies regarding this exist and hordes of Paly students continue to lament their lack of sleep.\r\n\r\nWhile self-identified \u201cmorning people\u201d may benefit from Zero Period PE, many sophomores take the class to enroll in as many as eight other academic classes during the school day. Although freshmen are <a href=\"http:\/\/paly.net\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-16_gr9_course_selection_form_front%26back.pdf\">prohibited<\/a> from joining more than seven classes, no limit exists for sophomores and upperclassmen.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt forces people who want to take many classes into taking Zero Period [PE] because it [taking many classes] is not an option otherwise,\u201d sophomore Julia Lauer said.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, morning people can still wake up early to complete school assignments, and thus do not need to take an early class to be productive.\r\n\r\nAccording to sophomore Jessica Wu, who signed up for nine classes in first semester, Zero Period PE contributed to an already high stress load.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was a super long day,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d arrive [at school] at seven and go home at five with no break. Then I would have extracurriculars, and that would give me no time to actually get work done until nine.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlthough Zero Period PE may cause less stress than early academic classes, it continues to strain students\u2019 stress and sleep levels. However, supporters maintain that because Zero Period PE is an optional class, it should always be available to those who wish to take it. In order to cooperate with students willing to wake in the early morning in exchange for an afternoon prep, an ideal solution is\u00a0to limit Zero Period students to a total of seven classes or make students who wish to take more that seven classes sign a waiver. In addition, advisers and counselors should warn against utilizing Zero Period PE as a tool for taking extra classes.","excerpt":"Zero Period Physical Education classes need reform in order to limit student stress and decrease sleep deprivation.\r\n","date":"2015-04-23 14:42:41","author":"Aidan Maese-Czeropski","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/ZEROPERIOD.jpg","categories":["Opinion"],"tags":{"8638":"debate","8751":"gunn","32445":"max mcgee","8927":"opinion","8944":"palo alto high school","8953":"paly","8980":"pe","9106":"sleep","9128":"Stress","42273":"zero period","42382":"zero period pe"}},{"id":102617,"title":"Opinion: Zero Period offers flexibility without detrimental effects","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/04\/23\/opinion-zero-period-offers-flexibility-without-detrimental-effects\/","content":"The most obvious defense of the controversial Zero Period \u2014 and what supporters of the policy have repeated time and time again \u2014 is that it\u2019s a choice. If a student wants to take an early morning class and start his or her school day earlier, he or she should have the freedom to do so. The ability to make mature decisions about scheduling is one that will be very important in future years. Students should be trusted with the power to determine what works best for their academic life and how they want to manage their time.\r\n\r\nAlthough concern over sleep deprivation among teenagers is reasonable when taking Zero Period into consideration, it should not be something that ultimately drives the elimination of the classes. To my knowledge, there has been no research done at PAUSD specifically to prove the correlation of sleep deprivation and Zero Period. In fact, some people may argue that Zero Period actually helps students go to sleep earlier, as it motivates them to manage their time better. Providing an opportunity for students to learn at an earlier time than usual does not necessarily lead to a surge in sleep-deprived students. Besides, some sports teams already implement morning practices and a handful of students arrive at school well before the first bell rings. If the goal is to ensure that everyone gets enough sleep, should PAUSD prohibit students from being on campus before a given time too?\r\n\r\nAdditionally, some people argue that Zero Period is used inappropriately by high-achieving students to take an extra class. They claim that students want to get ahead and have an advantage over their peers. While I agree with the fact that those students, if such students exist, are using the class for the wrong reason, I believe it would be wrong to take away Zero Period from everyone in order to combat this issue. Many students opt to take the class so that they can have a prep period later on in the day, according to comments made at the <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/04\/22\/students-plead-with-school-board-to-re-examine-zero-period-elimination\/\">school board meeting<\/a> this week. And, those who\u00a0sign up for a\u00a0Zero Period with the intention of taking an additional class could genuinely be interested their courses and are looking to challenge themselves. Restricting a student from their full potential in hopes of reaching complete academic equality is very counterproductive.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Zero Period, Paly\u2019s Zero Period PE in particular, should be offered in PAUSD.","excerpt":"Zero Period Physical Education is extremely beneficial to some and completely harmless to others, and it should be offered at PAUSD.","date":"2015-04-23 14:42:27","author":"Jeanette Wong","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/ZEROPERIOD.jpg","categories":["Opinion"],"tags":{"42383":"pro","9106":"sleep","42384":"sleep deprivation","42385":"student freedom","42273":"zero period"}},{"id":102539,"title":"Opinion: The Zero Period debate","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/04\/23\/opinion-the-zero-period-debate-2\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_102618\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"625\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/ZEROPERIOD.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-102618 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/ZEROPERIOD.jpg\" alt=\"sdfsdf\" width=\"625\" height=\"338\" \/><\/a> Students from Palo Alto High School Physical Education teacher Stacey Kofman's Zero Period PE class jog around the Paly track.

Non-academic Zero Period classes such as Physical Education, however, will continue to be implemented at both Palo Alto High School and Gunn High School. This decision resulted in mixed reaction from students: While some argued that abandoning Zero Period infringes on students\u2019 rights, others pointed out the need for sleep and limiting stress.\r\n\r\nThe Paly Voice discusses the pros and cons of Zero Period PE at Paly.

Each year, the event attracts more and more participants, and there are more volunteer organizations\u00a0present than ever before.\r\n\r\nStudents who have not already signed up to\u00a0volunteer at off-campus organizations are instead encouraged to participate in the available on-campus activities during lunch. Clubs and organizations will be on campus raising awareness for their respective causes and providing volunteer opportunities to students. No sign-ups are required, and free pizza will be served to those who participate in two or more activities.\r\n\r\n\"It is our hope that the students who participate in Service Day are able to find new ways to express their passions, find new ways to be involved and engaged in their communities, and find places where they can try new things,\" Wang said. \"Volunteering is a great way to get a feel for different career paths without heavy commitment for sacrifices.\"\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"overflow-y:hidden;\" src=\"https:\/\/magic.piktochart.com\/embed\/5660368-paly-service-day-2015\" width=\"620\" height=\"1183\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\nOrganizing this event took a large number of people, and Wang is grateful for the support and efforts of everyone\u00a0involved.\r\n\r\n\"This year, it was an incredible team effort,\" Wang said. \"More people have chipped in than ever before. YCS did an incredible job of organizing all 23 of the off-campus sites, and Key Club is putting all the effort humanly possible to create the best on-campus selection of clubs and organizations.
