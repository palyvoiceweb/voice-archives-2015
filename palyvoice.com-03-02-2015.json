All teens from local high schools, including but not limited to Paly and Gunn, are welcome to audition. The audition process, which will take around 15 minutes per person, will include reading brief scenes from the show. The plot of \"Ghost Bike\" focuses on the protagonist Ora journeying into the underworld to save her best friend Eddie. The Council hopes to cast between 10-20 teens, but the casting team comprised of student leaders plans to be flexible about the exact number of cast members.\r\n\r\nThe Teen Arts Council is known in\u00a0the Palo Alto community for hosting popular teen events such as Open Mics, Movie Nights and most recently,<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/01\/22\/sildeshow-teen-arts-council-point-b-poetry-jam\/\"> their inaugural poetry jam<\/a>.\r\n\r\nTeen Arts Council member and Paly junior Ophir Sneh plans on auditioning.\r\n\r\n\"I am looking forward the opportunity to get involved in an all-teen created production outside of school,\" Sneh said.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto Teen Arts Council will host auditions for its spring production of &#8220;Ghost Bike&#8221; at the Lucie Stern Community Center on Saturday, Feb. <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/02\/02\/teen-arts-council-to-host-spring-show-auditions\/#more-'\" class=\"more-link\">more &raquo;<\/a>","date":"2015-02-02 13:54:11","author":"Hannah Nguyen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/10917345_4713665376737_498558237196486035_n.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":[]},{"id":96405,"title":"Tout Sweet: The new T&#038;C sugar fix","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/02\/02\/tout-sweet-the-new-tc-sugar-fix\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_97394\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"284\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/IMG_0221.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-97394\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/IMG_0221.jpg\" alt=\"Tout Swet is a San Francisco sweet shop which recently opened a store at Town and Country.

Several Paly teachers invited students to participate in this activity on Monday after the school was informed of the death of a Gunn senior this past weekend. Photo by George Lu.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the Palo Alto High School community received\u00a0the devastating news of a Gunn High School senior who lost his life to suicide on Jan. 24.\r\n\r\nOur deep condolences go out to the family of the individual and the Gunn community. While withstanding great hardship, they have managed to inspire us with supporting one another. Even as we grieve with our friends and neighbors, The Paly Voice would like\u00a0to pause to appreciate the efforts made by Paly adults to support students on campus during such a difficult time on Monday and the past week overall.\r\n\r\nWhen a Gunn junior\u00a0<a title=\"Palo Alto teen killed on tracks Tuesday\" href=\"http:\/\/www.paloaltoonline.com\/news\/2014\/11\/04\/palo-alto-teen-killed-on-tracks-tuesday\" target=\"_blank\">died by suicide<\/a> last November, there was no announcement made to Paly students, and most teachers led class as if nothing out of the ordinary had\u00a0happened. Although the administration and some teachers <a title=\"Administration offers support in wake of Gunn student death\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/11\/04\/administration-offers-student-support-in-wake-of-gunn-student-death\/\" target=\"_blank\">were very supportive<\/a> the day of the November suicide, the increased level of teacher support on Monday was greatly noticed and appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe Paly Voice would like to recognize Paly's teachers and administrators\u00a0for addressing the issue of suicide and mental health, offering emotional support and making academic accommodations for students who may have been affected by the recent tragedy. We thank our administration for acknowledging that a Gunn suicide doesn't just affect Gunn; it affects all of us as a community. We can only imagine how our friends at Gunn are coping\u00a0and what's being done at their school, but we hope they feel similarly as to how we feel: that the\u00a0collective aid\u00a0we students received from the staff made an incredible\u00a0difference.\r\n\r\nAt the start of this past week, every single 1st Period teacher read a scripted email to their class, informing students about the events that occurred over the weekend and the resources for addressing mental health. Later that day, Principal Kim Diorio sent an <a title=\"Letter to Parents Jan. 26\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/2015-01-26-09-48-39_letter-to-parents-Jan-26.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">email<\/a> to parents, which included an excerpt of the scripted message.\r\n\r\nThis message noted\u00a0several out-of-classroom resources, such as crisis hotline phone numbers, contact to\u00a0<a title=\"Project Safety Net\" href=\"http:\/\/www.psnpaloalto.com\/psn-plan\/implementation\/intervention\/\" target=\"_blank\">Project Safety Net<\/a>\u00a0and the Paly counseling office. When the required script readings were finished, though, countless teachers offered themselves to students as resources for emotional support, reiterating\u00a0how much they care for us students and that they are always available if we need someone to talk to.\r\n\r\nThe support continued throughout the day, even after 1st Period ended. Many teachers put lesson plans on hold in place of a day for mental health.\u00a0Of the 30-some staff members on The Paly Voice, more than half of us had at least one class in which\u00a0we had zero academic instruction on Monday (not including our 6th Period Voice class).\r\n\r\nTeachers offered a range of effective methods to discuss our thoughts, release emotions and process our situation. Many English teachers shared the <a title=\"The Cosmos and You\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2008\/11\/02\/education\/edlife\/quoted.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">same inspirational article<\/a>\u00a0in class and offered students to write down any thoughts, feelings or questions they had on a sheet of paper and to talk about those thoughts if they so wished. This open-ended activity was helpful because everyone can process\u00a0suicide differently.\r\n\r\nAbout half of the staff members on The Paly Voice had classes that took part in a \u201cGratitude Wall,\u201d an initiative mainly occurring in the Social Studies Department. Students wrote what they were grateful for on sticky notes and posted their gratitude notes on the whiteboard. In addition to the Gratitude Wall, some Social Studies teachers led brief meditation sessions and showed a <a title=\"Andy Puddicombe: All it takes is 10 mindful minutes\" href=\"http:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/andy_puddicombe_all_it_takes_is_10_mindful_minutes\" target=\"_blank\">TED Talk on mindfulness<\/a>.\r\n\r\nNot only did teachers focus on mental health during class, but they also made accommodations for homework and exams this past week. More than three-quarters of staff members on The Paly Voice were offered\u00a0academic accommodations for at least one class (again, our assignments for The Paly Voice not included).\r\n\r\nThis made us feel that teachers could empathize with our current struggles. Quite often, requiring academic work when students are under emotional trauma impedes learning.\u00a0Several teachers are not collecting homework this week, and many decided to delay the dates for tests and quizzes or make their scores optional in the grade book. These accommodations are incredibly considerate for students who have been affected by recent events and simply need a few days to recalibrate themselves.\r\n\r\nAlthough not every teacher continued mental health-related discussions after\u00a0the initial announcement, the difference in support we received from November goes noticed and appreciated. The simple yet thoughtful acts from teachers such as sharing food with students or asking each individual, \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d really made us feel loved and assured us that we matter. We thank not only the teachers who made their support known to us students, but also the administration team who did more work for us this week than we could ever know about.\r\n\r\nWe are so fortunate to have such incredible, supportive adults at Paly.\u00a0Their\u00a0efforts inspire us to reach out for each other, especially the Gunn community. We are all a part of Palo Alto, and we are \"all in this together.\"","excerpt":"The Paly Voice would like to acknowledge our teachers for addressing the issue of suicide and mental health, offering emotional support and making academic accommodations for students who may have been affected by the recent tragedy in our community.","date":"2015-02-01 21:33:23","author":"The Paly Voice","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/rsz_img_0469.jpg","categories":["Editorial","Opinion","Spotlight"],"tags":{"32449":"editorial","11240":"emma chiu","8751":"gunn","8752":"gunn high school","8771":"homework","8834":"Kim Diorio","37655":"mental health","8939":"palo alto","8944":"palo alto high school","37653":"student death","9135":"suicide","37654":"support","9152":"teachers"}},{"id":80386,"title":"The ultimate pearl milk tea challenge: Perusing the Peninsula","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/02\/01\/the-ultimate-pearl-milk-tea-challenge-perusing-the-peninsula\/","content":"<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Welcome to the third\u00a0installment of the ultimate Pearl Milk Tea challenge.\u00a0You can find previous PMT reviews\u00a0<\/span><a style=\"color: #31318c;\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/category\/the-ultimate-pmt-challenge\/\" target=\"_blank\">here<\/a><span style=\"color: #000000;\">.<\/span>\n\nThis week, I found places on\u00a0the Peninsula\u00a0that are easy to get to if you are bored and\/or thirsty during the weekend.\n\n<strong>Comebuy<\/strong>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_96374\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/IMG_9719.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-96374\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/IMG_9719.jpg\" alt=\"Comebuy is found inside Hillsdale mall.

It is located on the second floor of the food court in the same area as\u00a0Wetzel's Pretzels and Yoppi Yogurt.\n\nComebuy is most well known for its noodle milk teas, according to the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.comebuy2002.com.tw\/en\/join\/join.php\">website<\/a>. Personally, I was unwilling to go all out and try the noodle milk tea, but the server highly recommended it. In the end, I opted for the safe green tea with pearls. Be careful. The first time I did this, I did not specify Pearl MILK Tea and was very unhappy when I had to reorder.\n\nThere are a lot of options to customize your drink in order to have the requested amount of sweetness and ice. I ordered the standard, but next time I would order less sweetness.\n\nThe pearls are very large and somewhat firm. For those of you who can relate, a mix of Tapioca Express and Verde's pearls seem like a perfect description for Comebuy's pearls. I ordered extra pearls and received a skimpy amount. They also gave me a larger size cup to accommodate for the \"extra\" pearls.\n\nIt is of the utmost importance to shake your drink once or else it will be very unbalanced, but overall, once shaken, the consistency is smooth but just a little too sweet. Comebuy uses the FIVESTARS reward system.\n\n<strong>Ocha Tea Cafe &amp; Restaurant<\/strong>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_96375\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/IMG_9989.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-96375\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/IMG_9989.jpg\" alt=\"Ocha was very bitter and watery.

Ocha serves PMT, but is mainly a restaurant.\n\nThere was a little bit of a line, but the rest of the restaurant was completely empty. Ocha does not make tapioca pearls until noon, so we had to wait even longer for our drinks than\u00a0expected.\n\nOnce the drink arrived, it was very watery and not milky at all. It had an incredibly strong tea flavor, but was not sweet enough to balance out the strength of the tea.\n\nThe one upside I found was the pearls. They were medium-sized, so it was not a struggle to fit them in the straw, and they were flavorful. They were quite chewy but tasted very fresh. They\u00a0were definitely worth the extra wait.\n\nThe rewards card shows certain flavor options that get stamped. Not only does a person have to buy 10 drinks before they can get a free drink, but they stamp the flavor you ordered also. (Side note: This is only for certain cashiers \u2013 many do not care what flavor you order.)\n\n<strong>Boba Cruz<\/strong>\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_96373\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/IMG_2407.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-96373 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/IMG_2407.jpg\" alt=\"Boba Cruz is thick and often a good sweetness.

The milk is very creamy and leaves a coating on your tongue. Boba Cruz varies in sweetness, however; I've gone multiple times and sometimes it's too sweet and sometimes it's perfect.\n\nWhenever I go there, there is a little bit of a line, but the service is very quick. It's very hard to get annoyed surrounded by the brightly colored walls and funky movie posters.\n\nThe crazy names and interesting pairings may not be everyone's cup of tea, but if you're feeling adventurous, it's definitely a good place to try.

Many of these efforts will be put into effect this school year, such as having a homework-free February break with no tests allowed on the following Tuesday and Wednesday; allowing flexibility when it comes to test and assignment scheduling due to the impact of the recent Henry M. Gunn High School student death by suicide; and proposing a number of minimum days for students, providing the staff with time to discuss homework policies and mindfulness training.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_97201\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"350\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/IMG_0472.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-97201\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/IMG_0472.jpg\" alt=\"Paly Principal Kim Diorio stands outside of the Tower Building.

Diorio and ASB worked to create a list of ways to reduce academic stress and improve the school climate. Photo by George Lu.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAfter the recent tragedy, Diorio felt that now was especially the time to begin implementing these ideas\u00a0instead of keeping them on the back burner.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe started having these conversations a year and a half ago, and we want people to understand this is not a knee jerk reaction,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cWe want to take action. We know this is an issue on our campus.\u201d\r\n\r\nDiorio understands that while these changes cannot solve the problem of mental health issues, she hopes that this will help alleviate unnecessary stress.\r\n\r\n\u201cRecognizing that suicide is an extremely complex mental health issue, we [the administration] acknowledge that academic \u2018stress is a problem, but not <i>the <\/i>problem,\u2019 as one Gunn student described for our community,\u201d Diorio said in the letter. \u201cHowever, we do have the power to take small steps to reduce stress and create opportunities for students to take a well-deserved break from the daily grind.\u201d\r\n\r\nOther possible structural modifications described in the letter will begin to be executed during the 2015-16 school year. These suggestions include working with the Education Council to create homework-free nights or weekends; preventing students from having more than two tests a day or allowing more freedom to reschedule tests; and having no major tests or projects due on seven-period C days.\r\n\r\nDiorio wanted to revise the C day schedule, particularly in response to recent feedback from parents, students and staff. Over 80 percent of parents and students stated their dislike of C days in the survey, but some teachers appreciate some aspects of having all seven periods in one day.\r\n\r\n\u201cSome teachers really like to have contact with students three days a week, so we decided we can keep C days but [to] change them,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous to spend all day Saturday and Sunday prepping for a C day. [With the new plan], there just wouldn\u2019t be heavy work for a C day \u2013 it\u2019d be more of a review day. We can also make a C day a minimum day, and then the teachers can stay and talk about homework.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents look forward to a changed C day schedule.\r\n\r\n\"[Changing]\u00a0C days would be beneficial because it would decrease the amount of homework assigned over the weekend,\u201d junior Sophie Swezey said. \u201cIt's also very difficult to get through seven classes in a day, and I feel like shorter periods are considerably less productive than block periods.\"\r\n\r\nDiorio also said she hopes that this letter will help promote increased discussion between students and teachers.\r\n\r\nStudents appreciate the sentiments the administration has been showing and acknowledge the support the school has been giving them during this difficult time.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think it [the letter] sounded really genuine and [that] things will get set in motion,\u201d senior Daryl Dillahunty said. \u201cI think when this [a death] happened before, nothing was really done and nothing was changed. I feel like now, there are plans being made and something will actually change. The students' feelings are really being taken into account, and our stress is finally being validated.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe letter also included a <a href=\"http:\/\/goo.gl\/AzyDmF\" target=\"_blank\">Google survey form<\/a>, which will allow students to provide feedback and suggestions about ways to improve the school climate and reduce stress.\r\n\r\nDiorio hopes to create a safe, supportive environment for students.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe want high school to be fun for you,\u201d Diorio said in the letter. \u201cWe want high school to be a place where you learn and grow. \u2026 We want high school to be a place where you feel your teachers and our entire staff care about you. We want you to know that you matter and you have a voice.\u201d\r\n\r\nDiorio emphasized the importance of students' well-being, not just their academic success.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s take time and put our lesson plans aside and focus on what\u2019s important,\u201d Diorio said.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>*Editor's note: Since the publishing of this article, the letter that Diorio wrote has been taken down from paly.net.

She also believes that\u00a0integrating technology will help to create an enjoyable classroom environment where students can thrive.\r\n\r\nWojcicki hopes that other teachers will adopt her methodology for changing the classroom set-up.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy idea is to give other teachers ideas for how they can do the same thing in the classrooms,\u201d Wojcicki said in an interview with The Paly Voice.\r\n\r\n<strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The Paly Voice:\u00a0<\/span>Could you give us a brief description of your book?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nWojcicki: It is basically how to teach [and] how to change the culture of a classroom. [It\u2019s] how to teach 21st century skills without lecturing to students. The reason it\u2019s called \u201cMoonshots in Education\u201d is because it takes a tremendous amount of energy and conviction to actually do it. I think it\u2019s even harder than a moonshot, because teachers don\u2019t typically want to change the culture of their classroom.\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV: What inspiration did you have for writing the book?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nWojcicki:\u00a0The main inspiration are my classes and my students, because over the years I see what a difference it [the journalism program] can make in the lives of students. And not just while they\u2019re in my class, but after they graduate from high school and even after they graduate from college. Many of them come back and tell me that this [journalism] was the single most important class they ever took. So then I thought, maybe I should share this with other teachers. What am I doing that is so unusual? So I had to go back and look at what I was doing to try and understand what was so unusual about it, because I didn\u2019t really know at that point.\r\n\r\n<strong><strong>TPV:\u00a0<\/strong>How have your ideas on blended learning influenced how you teach in the classroom?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nWojcicki:\u00a0In most of my classes, I do more than the average project-based learning. \u2026 The reason I adopted blended learning is because it\u2019s a movement that says that approximately 50 percent of the class time should be devoted to the [project-based] collaborative work while the other 50 percent of the time is devoted to lecturing.\r\n\r\n<strong><strong>TPV:\u00a0<\/strong>What is your favorite part about teaching journalism?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nWojcicki:\u00a0Well, first of all, my favorite part is the students. ... Every year they are different and I learn a lot from being in the classroom with them. A journalist is supposed to be able to be the first one to tell everyone what\u2019s going on. So if more people can get information and analyze it correctly and think about it, the whole society will be better off. I think journalism is the best training that a student can have.\r\n\r\n<strong><strong>TPV:\u00a0<\/strong>Where can we buy the book?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nWojcicki:\u00a0It [the first round] is already sold out, but it should be on Amazon. Also they\u2019re bringing in 200 copies at the JCC for purchase. Also, there will be a Kindle version if anyone wants to read it in that form.\r\n\r\n<strong><strong>TPV:\u00a0<\/strong>What would you say your favorite publication at Paly is?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nWojcicki:\u00a0That\u2019s like asking who\u2019s your favorite child ... It\u2019s hard for me to say. They\u2019re all great. I hope no one will get offended that I didn\u2019t pick them.","excerpt":"The Paly Voice sat down with Palo Alto High School journalism teacher Esther Wojcicki to discuss her book \u201cMoonshots in Education: Blended Learning in the Classroom.\u201d","date":"2015-01-29 19:27:18","author":"Adele Bloch","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Screen-Shot-2015-01-26-at-10.21.12-PM.png","categories":["Features","Spotlight"],"tags":{"37647":"book","12704":"esther wojcicki","37714":"jcc","8814":"journalism","37646":"Moonshots in Education","37645":"Woj"}},{"id":96258,"title":"Hungry?

The cost will now be $105 per test, a $10 reduction from last year's fee, according to the schools <a href=\"http:\/\/paly.net\/news\/ap-2015-registration-information\">website<\/a>. AP Chinese and Japanese will be $135 per test, also a $10 reduction from last year's fee.\r\n\r\nThe decision to lower the cost sprung from information that Paly was overcharging its students, and was charging more than most other schools in\u00a0the Bay Area, as described in a previous\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/03\/11\/advanced-placement-testing-prices-costly-for-paly-and-gunn-students\/\">Paly Voice\u00a0article.<\/a>\r\n\r\n\"The administration, after looking at the numbers discussed with The Paly Voice\u00a0over the last few weeks, felt comfortable lowering the price of the exams for the year and will review the pricing annually,\" Assistant Principal Jerry Berkson said.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_96937\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"400\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/photo2.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-96937\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/photo2.jpg\" alt=\"photo\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" \/><\/a> Senior Viv Bhatia studies for the AP Physics exam in the Academic Resource Center.

Photo by Lydia Barry.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe College Board charged $89 per test in 2014, but many schools added on a sum of money to cover supplies needed to administer the test. With tests costing $115 in 2014, Paly collected an extra $26 per test.\r\n\r\nSome of that money went to funding AP testing-related resources such as proctors and supplies. However, data provided by Paly administrators revealed that the school had a remaining sum of money from the AP tests and that those excess funds were used to buy a range of general school supplies such as dry erase markers for classrooms and technical equipment not directly related to the AP tests themselves.\r\n\r\nThe numbers recorded by the Paly administration in the schools testing fund for the 2014 AP tests were:<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/photo2.jpg\">\r\n<\/a>\r\n\r\n<em>Collected testing fees: $159,438.58<\/em>\r\n\r\n<em>Cost of exams: $112,707<\/em>\r\n\r\n<em>Proctors: $17,719.52<\/em>\r\n\r\n<em>Additional fees*: $4,063.68<\/em>\r\n\r\nThat results in $24,948.38\u00a0leftover after proctors and additional fees had been paid for. With the amount of money paid per test in 2014 at Paly, the school could have charged $105 per test and still have had money remaining.\r\nFor this spring, the College Board increased the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/apstudent.collegeboard.org\/takingtheexam\/exam-fees\">testing cost<\/a> to $91, meaning Paly will make $14 per test instead of last years $26.\r\n\r\nPaly administration will not know exactly how much extra money it has until all tests have been paid for and taken, and risks losing money with its lowered cost, but its new cost of $105 per test will still be higher than most Bay Area schools.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Screen-Shot-2015-01-27-at-2.03.25-PM.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-96929 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Screen-Shot-2015-01-27-at-2.03.25-PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-01-27 at 2.03.25 PM\" width=\"652\" height=\"320\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nMany students were unaware of the additional cost charged to them in 2014, and do not believe the school should have been able to use AP testing funds for things unrelated to the test themselves.\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to know beforehand if what I am paying is partially a donation,\" senior Conner Harden said. \"Palo Alto schools should only make the students\u00a0in AP classes pay the bare minimum for the cost of the test. If a student likes, they can donate money to the school, but not without being notified.\"\r\n\r\nParents, who generally pay for AP tests for their students, were surprised by the additional charge of an AP test and do not believe the schools should continue to overcharge them.\r\n\r\n\"With so many years of data, Paly and Gunn should be able to forecast these expenses fairly accurately,\" Paly alumni parent Liz Raffel said. \"There's really no excuse for excess profits in the amounts mentioned, and it's just wrong for AP test-takers to be funding, unknowingly, general supplies for the entire school.\"\r\n\r\nAnother Paly alumni parent, Katharine Glazier, echoes Raffel's sentiments.\r\n\r\n\"It seems that the school has unfairly made a nice bit of money off the backs of the AP students and their parents,\" Glazier said.\r\n\r\nAP test takers are appreciative that the administration has made the effort to lower the cost following last year's dramatic over-charge.\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't okay for them to overcharge us, but I'm glad the administration has realized its mistake and has decided to lower the cost,\" senior\u00a0Olivia Johnson said. \"For students taking AP tests, this will make a difference.\"\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>*Additional fees include custodial staff costs during AP testing, testing supplies such as snacks, tech support, headphones for listening portions of certain AP tests and AP Conference costs (teachers attend training before they can teach an AP course).\u00a0<\/em>","excerpt":"Paly administration lowers the cost per AP test for the 2014-15 school year.
