With the win, the Vikings clinched a spot in the Central Coast Section playoffs, as the top four teams in the De Anza League are guaranteed a spot.\r\n\r\nAccording to head coach Jake Halas, controlling the ball was the deciding factor in this game.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe were able to control the ball, run the rock,\u201d Halas said. \u201cWe take our chances. We\u2019ve got Eli [Givens] and we can throw some deep balls to him too.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe game began with a strong kick-off return play, with senior wide receiver Eli Givens running the ball all the way into the end zone for a touchdown for the second consecutive game, the last against Los Gatos High School.\r\n\r\n\u201cI said I was going to take it to the house one more time on the very first play,\u201d Givens said. \u201cThey kicked it to me and I was very surprised because I thought they would\u2019ve seen Los Gatos [High School], but I guess they didn\u2019t. I just took it to the house.\u201d\r\n\r\nKick-off return plays and special teams have been a focus for the Vikings in recent weeks, according to Halas.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe improved our kick return game,\u201d Halas said. \u201cWe\u2019ve actually spent more time on our special teams lately too. The goal of any good team around here is to get better every game.\u201d\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Halas recognized the Vikings\u2019 improvement and the players becoming more comfortable and on point in each job, making the team more cohesive as a whole.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe made some adjustments in practices and we got guys in the right spot,\u201d Halas said. \u201cEarlier in the year, we had guys running through the wrong gaps and wide open gaps. We fixed and have been tweaking that.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Homestead head coach Milo Lewis, the Mustangs didn\u2019t exhibit their skills strongly, but still have hopes for advancing to the Central Coast Section playoffs, as the Vikings will most likely do.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not our best performance,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cWe\u2019re a lot better than we just showed. We\u2019ve got two games left. We\u2019ve got to try to get one of the two, Milpitas [High School] or Los Gatos.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe game opened with the traditional ceremonies of Senior Night, recognizing the team\u2019s seniors and their families. Friday night's win was meaningful, according to Givens, especially given losses on Senior Night in the last two seasons.\r\n\r\n\u201cWatching these games for Senior Night and seeing a loss makes you just feel hopeless,\u201d Givens said. \u201cYou come back to the locker room and you see all the seniors crying, but there\u2019s nothing you can really do about it. I\u2019d seen that and I didn\u2019t want that happening to me.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Vikings have one more game in the regular season against Wilcox (6-2, 2-2). The Vikings will be focusing on recovering and preparing for Wilcox\u2019s physical offensive game, according to Halas.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey match up well,\u201d Halas said. \u201cThey\u2019re very physical up front. It\u2019s going to be a very good game. [The veer] is their offensive scheme. It\u2019s a hard-hitting, physical style of offense. They run it really well and they\u2019ve been running it for years.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Vikings\u2019 determination and work rate brings them success, according to senior running back Takeru Nishi.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe worked the whole week and it really paid off,\u201d Nishi said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get to the playoffs last year and we just really wanted to get there this year.\u201d\r\n\r\nPaly will take on the Wilcox Chargers at 7 p.m. on Nov. 13 at Wilcox High School, its last game of the regular season. The Vikings will be looking for redemption, as they lost to the Chargers last season with a score of 20-19.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School football team (4-5, 3-2) blew out the Homestead Mustangs (3-5, 1-3) on Friday for Senior Night, the Vikings last home game of the season, 45-7.

The data points revealed that historically underrepresented racial group students at Palo Alto high schools score significantly lower than those of Caucasian or Asian ethnicity.\r\n\r\n\u201cIncreasing achievement for underrepresented minorities is a high priority,\u201d board member Ken Dauber said. \u201cBut we need to do more, including improving how well curriculum and teaching meets the needs of all students and examining how well laning is supporting students in increasing achievement.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Minority Achievement and Talent Development committee, created earlier this year, is working with elementary schools to combat the issues of struggling students as early as kindergarten and first grade. MATD is providing increased access to support resources for students and their parents, according to Judy Argumedo, the PAUSD director of Academic Supports\r\n\r\nIn\u00a0addition to establishing\u00a0the MATD committee, the school board members also implemented early literacy and math after school programs for non-native English speakers at the Hoover and Fairmeadow elementary schools in order to help students catch up at an early age.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve talked to a lot of historically underrepresented racial group parents whose kids are struggling in math,\" school board president Melissa Caswell said. \"I believe that if you wait until middle school, you\u2019ll never be able to catch up.\"\r\n\r\nThe board members also discussed the necessity of changing the overall climate surrounding Advanced Placement courses. The board emphasized the importance of encouraging all students to take advanced classes and providing them with access to a more rich education through these courses.\r\n\r\n\u201cSome kids in our district may feel intimidated by the APs, thinking that they are only for a select group,\u201d board member Camille Townsend said. \u201cThis should become a continual focus that our that kids take at least one AP class, so they gain confidence in themselves.\u201d\r\n\r\nCaswell emphasized that the board will be focusing on improving the quality of education across all the schools within the district.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe need to ask [ourselves], \u2018Are we providing advanced topics to enough of our kids?\u2019\u201d Caswell said.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto Unified School District Board of Education plans to take action to improve school climate and decrease the achievement gap of historically underrepresented racial groups within the school district.\r\n","date":"2015-10-29 21:44:38","author":"Sherwin Amsbaugh","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/IMG_4144.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["achievement gap","ACT","AP testing","Camille Townsend","ken dauber","Melissa Caswell","sat"]},{"id":111002,"title":"Football takes on Homestead in Senior Night","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/10\/29\/football-takes-on-homestead-in-senior-night\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_111004\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"581\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/I9P6770.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-111004\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/I9P6770.jpg\" alt=\"_I9P6770\" width=\"581\" height=\"387\" \/><\/a> Sophomore running back Paul Jackson III runs the ball during the Palo Alto High School Homecoming game last Friday.

Considering the long way and all that these refugees endured, I have so much respect for each and every one of the Syrian refugees.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\nAfter witnessing the refugee\u00a0crisis firsthand, Graham believes that countries should be more heavily involved in saving lives.\r\n\r\n\"Take refugees into your country, provide them with the basic necessities and make them thrive,\" Graham said. \"Train them to be able to work, so they can support their families, so the cycle of poverty doesn't either continue or begin. Even just letting them pass through all of the European countries so they can reach their destination could be better than putting up barricades and putting them through more emotional, physical and mental pain.\"\r\n\r\nBut one does not have to be located in Western Europe to provide a helping hand.

At first it was for health reasons, but then I saw a video on Facebook on factory farms that made me not want to contribute [to the meat industry.]\r\n\r\nTPV: Do you like being vegan?\r\n\r\nCM: It\u2019s really fun. I love fruits and\u00a0veggies, and\u00a0there\u2019s also a great community of vegans. I look up to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/essenaoneill\" target=\"_blank\">Essena ONeill<\/a>, a vegan YouTuber who travels a lot and is really compassionate. We have a lot of similar qualities.\r\n\r\nTPV: I\u2019ve heard you have a cow costume?\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_109168\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"277\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/12086910_10203608407811147_1601616122_n.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-109168\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/12086910_10203608407811147_1601616122_n.jpg\" alt=\"Mclntosh poses in her dalmatian costume for Halloween with a 1\/2 eaten banana and her cat Chewy.

I thought it would be cool to be a dalmatian for Halloween and [in the picture] I was also holding a half eaten banana and my fat cat Chewy was just there...I also own a banana costume.\r\n\r\nTPV: Tell me more about your cat.\r\n\r\nCM: I\u2019ve had him since 2nd grade. He weighs 30 pounds and likes\u00a0to lie on his back to\u00a0tan in the sun.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_109169\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"237\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/12071711_10203608406451113_1573525640_n.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-109169\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/12071711_10203608406451113_1573525640_n.jpg\" alt=\"12071711_10203608406451113_1573525640_n\" width=\"237\" height=\"316\" \/><\/a> Mclntosh's cat, Chewy, likes to sun tan upside-down.

Some of my favorite running spots are Foothills, Lake Lagunita and the Dish.\r\n\r\nTPV: What\u2019s the weirdest thing in your fridge?\r\n\r\nCM: Kelp noodles. I looked up this recipe that needed kelp noodles so I went to Country Sun [grocery store] and got them. They are very kelpy. You have to mix them in with something else or else it just tastes like the ocean.\r\n\r\nTPV: What\u2019s your message to the rest of Paly?\r\n\r\nCM: Think about your actions today and if they\u2019re contributing to where you want to be in the future.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"This week, The Paly Voice sat down with senior Chelsea Mclntosh to learn about the her passion for bananas, running and her cat.","date":"2015-10-26 12:01:40","author":"Will Zhou","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/IMG_1807.jpg","categories":["Features"],"tags":["banana","cat","chelsea mclntosh","kelp","vegan","voice of the week","yoga"]}]
