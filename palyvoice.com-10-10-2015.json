Svirsky was pulled from the position later in the season and moved to wide receiver in favor of teammate Justin Hull, a senior who last week led the Vikings to a <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/10\/04\/football-takes-down-saratoga-in-league-opener\/\">42-35 double-overtime victory<\/a> over the Saratoga Falcons (1-3, 0-1).\r\n\r\nWhile Svirsky regained the position for the team's final two games when Hull suffered a concussion late last season, he transferred this past summer to Milpitas and earned the starting quarterback role there.\r\n\r\nAlthough Friday's matchup will be the first time Svirsky faces his former teammates, he says he is treating the game like any other.\r\n\r\n\"I'm just taking it as another game just like my teammates and as another chance to go out to war with my brothers here like every week,\" Svirsky said.\r\n\r\nThis season, Svirsky currently has five touchdown passes, five rushing touchdowns and two interceptions, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.maxpreps.com\/high-schools\/milpitas-trojans-(milpitas,ca)\/football\/stats.htm\">according to Maxpreps.com<\/a>. On the flip side, Hull has 14 touchdowns but seven interceptions.\r\n\r\nThe Trojans present an up-tempo offense for the Vikings' defense, paced by a trifecta of running backs each with at least 30 carries on the season: seniors Cros Chavez and Dejaun Crummie and sophomore Tariq Bracy.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings opened up league play strongly last week as Hull accounted for five of the team's six touchdowns.\r\n\r\nAccording to Hull's leading wide receiver Eli Givens, the team will be facing a big challenge in the Trojans' defensive line.\r\n\r\n\"We are going to be facing a very good defensive-line that will try and scare us with their size and will have to overcome that,\" Givens said.\r\n\r\nSvirsky remains confident in his team's ability to stick to it's game plan, even against his old team.\r\n\r\n\"We are focused on playing our game,\" Svirsky said. \"It's not about the opposing team, it's about us and playing our game.\"\r\n\r\nGivens, who grew up as one of Svirsky's close friends, noted that playing his friend will make the game interesting.\r\n\r\n\"I think it will be exciting to play [Svirsky],\" Givens said. \"I have never played against one of my closest friends like this in football and it will be interesting. I think it won't affect the game that much though because we know what we have to do to win and I think we are ready.\"\r\n\r\nThe game will kick off at 7 p.m. tomorrow at Milpitas High School.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School football team (2-3, 1-0) will look to earn it's second De Anza league win when it travels to Milpitas High School this Friday to take on the Trojans (3-2, 1-0), a team led by a familiar face to the Vikings.","date":"2015-10-08 21:31:23","author":"Josh Yuen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/PaulJIII.jpg","categories":["Football","Sports","Spotlight"],"tags":["givens","halas","hull","milpitas","Paly football","svirsky"]},{"id":109347,"title":"Model United Nations to participate in intergenerational conference","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/10\/08\/model-united-nations-to-participate-in-intergenerational-conference\/","content":"Palo Alto High School's Model United Nations club will attend its first conference of the year this weekend at University of California, Berkeley.\r\n\r\nThe Intergenerational Model UN conference is a unique conference in that it gives the opportunity for delegates of any age to participate, according to MUN researcher Tara Madhav.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's not only a high school conference, but for delegates who are adults and even middle schoolers,\u201d Madhav said. \u201cIt's really for anyone who is interested in Model UN.\u201d\r\n\r\nMUN is a club intended for students to learn and discuss current world politics and events. For\u00a0conferences such as the Intergenerational conference, each student will be assigned a committee with a specific topic and a country. Students must then research their country and its position. They will then write a paper and debate\u00a0with other delegates to find a solution.\r\n\r\nAccording to Madhav, the Intergenerational conference is more educational and slow-paced in comparison to other MUN conferences. However, Madhav hopes the conference will serve to get the veteran delegates accustomed to the process once more, and give the new delegates a feel for MUN conferences.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_109348\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"481\"]<img class=\"wp-image-109348\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/12076931_825233570926770_1643289003_n.jpg\" alt=\"12076931_825233570926770_1643289003_n\" width=\"481\" height=\"361\" \/> Paly's Model United Nation (MUN) delegates and advisors pose at last year's Intergenerational conference.

The newly appointed researchers will compile research binders for the upcoming conference, which will enable MUN members to excel during the events by utilizing the useful sources, according to MUN President Eli Craverio Frankel.\r\n\r\nTo prepare for the event, the club is additionally organizing a Paly student veteran camp to help people refresh for the conference, according to Madhav.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe look forward to all the veterans getting back in shape for the year, and in general, an educational experience,\u201d Madhav said.","excerpt":"The Model United Nations (MUN) club will attend its first conference of the year this weekend at University of California, Berkeley.","date":"2015-10-08 11:17:56","author":"Emilia Diaz-Magaloni","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/12076931_825233570926770_1643289003_n.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":["club","Eli Craveiro Frankel","Intergenerational","model united nations","mun","Tara Madhav"]},{"id":109291,"title":"Voice of the Week: Dave Peters","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/10\/08\/voice-of-the-week-dave-peters\/","content":"&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_109318\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/IMG_2945.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-109318\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/IMG_2945.jpg\" alt=\"Math teacher Dave Peters presents the inverse trigonometry derivatives his BC Calculus students are learning.

It\u2019s not only the theorems and all of that, but the homework problems are more complicated so I have to do them all myself so I know what\u2019s going on. If a student asks a question I don\u2019t like to be in the front of the room thinking about it for the first time. I like to be able to say \u201cOh yeah, there\u2019s this sneaky step here, or a lot of students do this when this works,\" so it\u2019s definitely taken a lot of extra preparation, but I love it. I love teaching BC, and I loved teaching AB. Calculus is fun.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TPV: Do you prefer teaching seniors or freshmen?<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DP: Again, I don\u2019t really have a preference. It\u2019s apples and oranges. All the students are nice. I\u2019m fortunate to be teaching BC and Geo H this year, which are both in the honors lane. When I started out here I was teaching the Geometry regular [class] and sometimes you could get a couple of characters. But everybody\u2019s so nice in the honors lane, even if they\u2019re struggling with the calculus. I just have a really great relationship with my classes, and it\u2019s been that way for a couple years. It\u2019s kind of hard to complain about though, it\u2019s not Los Angeles Unified [School District], there\u2019s no metal detector when you enter the school. But occasionally you\u2019ll have a rambunctious group, depending on the grade and section you\u2019re teaching.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TPV: Do you have a\u00a0favorite theorem?<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DP: Usually when I go home, I stop thinking about math. Some people who live and breathe math, they might have a favorite theorem, but I\u2019m not that guy.<\/span>\u00a0I think I\u2019m good at math, and I\u2019m really good at explaining things to people, and I think that\u2019s what makes me a good math teacher. You could be a genius at math and be terrible at explaining things to people and that would make you a bad teacher, and I definitely had a couple of those in college. ... I think I love teaching more than I love math.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TPV: How would you describe your Twitter aesthetic?<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DP: Sadly, I have not been on Twitter as much as I have been on [it] in the past, because my life is just so busy, but I say that every semester. Last semester I was finishing graduate school, the semester before that I was taking two classes and I had just had a baby. The semester before that I was in the middle of graduate school and my wife was pregnant. I kept looking forward and I thought \u201cOh, well, once graduate school\u2019s done,\u201d but this semester we moved to a new house, which is bananas, and my wife is pregnant again and we\u2019re going to have another baby in January, and the BC was dropped on me. And so now, where I didn\u2019t think I was going to have a new class this year, it\u2019s not just any class, it\u2019s the BC Calculus where I have to do every problem. I would like to tweet more, but it's just that sometimes I go home and I just need to sit on the couch, you know what I mean?<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have a separate Twitter account, where I follow people\u00a0but\u00a0I don\u2019t really tweet, and I have a public account. When you teach, they say for instance \"Don\u2019t become Facebook friends with your students because there\u2019s this awkward line and you don\u2019t want to cross over it.\" So, I knew if I was going to have a Twitter account I couldn\u2019t \"work blue,\" it would have to be very clean, so if any parent or board member read them they\u2019d have to be okay. I realized some of the comedians I follow are so dirty I don\u2019t even want to be connected with them that way, so my Twitter account is very sanitized ...\u00a0but I still try to be as humorous as I can with it, and you know, sometimes I just tweet a picture of my daughter because she\u2019s awesome.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\nTPV: Do you have any tips for relaxation, or managing time, or things that you wish students did that would make their lives easier?\r\n\r\nDP: You know, that\u2019s a really good question. It\u2019s tough because I think it varies so much from person to person. I think we all say this is a stressful environment, but it affects different people in different ways. \u00a0If you tell one person you need to do relaxation exercises and yoga, it might be great for them and for other people it might not work at all. And so, it\u2019s hard to just say \u201cHere\u2019s one thing everyone can do\u201d because I don\u2019t think that counts. I don\u2019t think there is a thing like that. But I get it man, I\u2019m really stressed, I always feel like I have a million things going on.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TPV: What was your least favorite class in high school?<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DP: I would say my least favorite subject was history, but I was still pretty lucky because I still had really great teachers. I had one guy my freshman and junior year for Advanced Placement U.S History. I didn\u2019t do well in APUSH, I didn\u2019t take the exam, but I loved my history teacher. So, even with something that I was not a big fan of, I ended up liking it because of the teacher. I think the teacher can be very make-or-break, I think sometimes you hear students say things like \u201cI hate math,\u201d and maybe it\u2019s not the math. Maybe it\u2019s because in 6th grade they had some teacher who was awful, who just derailed them, and they just assumed it was something with them and not the instruction. But I don\u2019t think I had a least favorite course in high school. I definitely like math a lot because I was good at it and it came naturally to me, but otherwise I was pretty ok with the rest of my courses. There wasn\u2019t anything I hated.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TPV: If you were to substitute for a class, what class would you substitute for?<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DP: I wouldn\u2019t mind substituting \u2013 well I guess this is not just a one day babysit a class, say I had to fill in for two weeks \u2013 and they couldn\u2019t find anybody and they put me in there for some wacky reason. I guess I wouldn\u2019t mind substituting for an English class if they were working on a novel I found interesting. I remember I enjoyed most of the books I read in high school, so if there was a class reading <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1984<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or something, I think that would be interesting. I wouldn\u2019t want to grade their essays though. I barely want to grade math tests.\u00a0<\/span>","excerpt":"This week, The Paly Voice sat down with math teacher Dave Peters to learn about the X, Y and Zs of his job, his high school days and his Twitter aesthetic.

Berkson added that\u00a0there are companies that have mailing lists of households of certain demographics, which is how the organizer was able to mail the flyers out.\r\n\r\n\u201cLegally, the Paly sign or logo isn\u2019t trademarked or anything,\u201d Berkson said. \u201cHe [the organizer] didn\u2019t do anything illegal. But whether it\u2019s unethical or not? If you ask 10 different people, you\u2019ll get 10 different opinions.

We received some great verbal feedback and many people stayed afterwards to ask questions.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Yin, this was the first time IntoWealth has hosted a workshop at Paly, but the company generally conducts workshops all over the Bay Area, including the lecture hall at its main office, other high school campuses and test preparation centers.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, the Palo Alto Unified School District has recently implemented a policy which states PAUSD will no longer rent school campuses to for-profit organizations for college counseling and standardized testing preparation.\u00a0According to Berkson, the new policy came into effect before the controversy surrounding the flyer, but after\u00a0the organizer's contract was signed. PAUSD's decision was made independent of this incident. However, this coincidence prompted concern from some people, Berkson said.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe [the administration] received a phone call from a parent about the workshop saying, 'Hey I thought you didn\u2019t do this [host events by for-profit organizations on campus] anymore,'\u201d Berkson said. \u201cI had to explain to them that the organizer's contract was signed before this whole thing.\"","excerpt":"Following a college-help organization's distribution of a deceptive promotional flyer, which included the Palo Alto High School sign for a non-school-affiliated event, the administration is not taking any action.","date":"2015-10-06 20:23:23","author":"Jeanette Wong","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/final-featured-image.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["admin","college help","college workshop","deceitful","deceptive","financial aid","flyer","fraudulous flyer","jerry berkson","palo alto high school","scandal","victoria kim"]},{"id":108670,"title":"Alumnus composes music for fall production","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/10\/06\/alumnus-composes-music-for-fall-production\/","content":"Professional actor, composer and Palo Alto High School alumnus Jonathan Shue, Class of 2001, is collaborating with students to create\u00a0original music for the theater department's fall show, \"The Odyssey\".\r\n\r\nStudents are working with the framework of previous music composed for a production of the Odyssey at Monta Vista High School to create a contemporary musical accompaniment, according to Shue.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I compose music for plays like this, where we have actors who aren't necessarily trained musicians, it's important to me that the music comes from their heart and soul and that they have a hand in the creative process,\u201d Shue said.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_109398\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"468\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/12092197_914983975244358_742084578_n.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-109398\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/12092197_914983975244358_742084578_n.jpg\" alt=\"12092197_914983975244358_742084578_n\" width=\"468\" height=\"351\" \/><\/a> Actors rehearse for the Odyssey, Paly Theater's fall production, outside the Haymarket. \"The Odyssey\" will begin showing at the Haymarket Theatre August 25-27.

Photo by Nika Woodfill.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nIn this week's edition of Tuesday Tunes, The Paly Voice sat down with accomplished guitarist and RAJ band member senior Russell Star-Lack to ask how music has impacted his life.\r\n\r\nAccording to Star-Lack, who primarily plays guitar and sings, music helps him relieve the stress that comes with being a student.\r\n\r\n\u201cI listen to it [music] constantly, I play it constantly, I write it constantly,\u201d Star-Lack said. \u201cIt is the best way for me to deal with stress. If I have an issue, I might write a song about it or find one I can relate to, and it will help me deal with stuff.\"\r\n\r\nStar-Lack grew up around music and fell in love with it at an early age.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dad played guitar, and I thought that was really cool,\u201d Star-Lack said. \u201cWhen I was six, I was in the car with my mom and [Eric Clapton's] 'Layla' came on the radio and I thought, \u2018Oh my God, this is awesome. I want to do that.\u2019 And that's \u00a0really what got me started playing music.\u201d\r\n\r\nStar-Lack loves to find his inspiration from classic blues and rock legends.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy favorites are Eric Clapton and all the great guitar guys \u2014 Hendrix, the Allman brothers and Jimmy Page with Led Zeppelin,\u201d Star-Lack said. \u201cFor blues, Muddy Waters, Robert Johnson, Howlin\u2019 Wolf, BB King, Albert King, Freddie King, Stevie Ray Vaughan and Gary Clark Jr. All these guys are great and not appreciated enough.\u201d\r\n\r\nStar-Lack in particular loves blues for the raw emotion in its lyricism.\r\n\r\n\u201cBlues is really where it's at for me,\u201d Star-Lack said. \u201cThere\u2019s just something about the emotion in blues. It's oftentimes not as technically as advanced, but there's just this raw feeling in the lyrics that really show what was going on in the singer's mind at the time.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn his free time, Star-Lack likes to perform with his band RAJ, which are the initials of the other band members, including seniors Arjun Vasudevan and Jeremy Samos.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t take a lot of risks in my life, and I think that performing is how I get that feeling,\" Star-Lack said. \"It\u2019s addictive. I feel like I can express myself a lot better when I\u2019m performing in front of my friends, people who know or don\u2019t know me, than if I\u2019m just talking. I\u2019m very introverted, and it\u2019s kind of fun to be the exact opposite, to play guitar behind your head and sing really loud and just be crazy and have fun.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Star-Lack, it\u2019s important for people to expand their horizons and discover the world that music has to offer.\r\n\r\n\u201cI encourage people to at least try, or listen to different kinds of music,\u201d Star-Lack said. \u201cI consider myself a listener of music even more than I am a player of it. So even just listening to stuff you don\u2019t normally listen to and challenging yourself can really help broaden perspectives and maybe even help learn more about the world.\u201d\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/embed.spotify.com\/?uri=spotify%3Auser%3A1216334347%3Aplaylist%3A7As6tRWJbyWOptsYhbTR6j\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>","excerpt":"In this week's edition of Tuesday Tunes, The Paly Voice sat down with accomplished guitarist and RAJ band member senior Russell Star-Lack to ask how music has impacted his life.\r\n","date":"2015-10-06 11:36:33","author":"Sherwin Amsbaugh","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/FullSizeRender-1.jpg","categories":["Entertainment","Spotlight","Tuesday Tunes"],"tags":["Arjun Vasudevan","Blues","Guitar","Jeremy Samos","music","RAJ","Rock","Russell Star-Lack","Tuesday Tunes"]}]
