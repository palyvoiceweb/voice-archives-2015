It was a typical regular season league game, and the Vikings uneventfully fell short by a score of 6-1. It was during the last inning when the Vikings, having been out-dueled all game offensively by the pitching of Bruins phenom Kathryn Caravalho, finally showed signs of life for the first time. \r\n\r\nFreshman first baseman Sophie Frick worked the count full against Caravalho, who prior to the at-bat had only allowed two hits in the game. Even though her team trailed by six runs, Frick continued to persist by fouling off multiple pitches. On the eighth pitch of the at-bat, she ripped a double down the left-field line, knocking in the first run of the game for the Vikings, her teammates and coaches applauding. She's been doing that kind of thing all season. \r\n\r\nPlaying on a team with 10 upperclassmen, it would be natural to assume that Frick wouldn't receive the starting job at first base and a spot in the middle of the order. But after an impressive performance early in the season, her manager Bill Laskey did just that. \r\n\r\nAs it turns out, Frick isn't just good at softball. In the fall, she helped lead the girls' water polo team's push into the CCS playoffs. Later, she became a part of Coach Scott Peters' eight-player rotation, playing key minutes throughout a championship season for girls' basketball. She also finished in the top three on the softball team in hits (18), runs batted in (14), and batting average (.316), according to MaxPreps.com. \r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_104992\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"590\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/11303970_1602089120038641_1694026943_o.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-104992\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/11303970_1602089120038641_1694026943_o.jpg\" alt=\"Freshman Sophie Frick looks to pass to a nearby teammate in a home water polo game against Mountain View.

Maybe two. Playing three sports year-round in high school is a feat that requires not just athleticism, but patience, determination, and a consistently assiduous attitude. What about three sports, all at the varsity level, as a <em>freshman<\/em> in high school? Is that even sustainable? \r\n\r\nFor Frick, it's more than just possible. It's a lifestyle. Palo Alto High School's next super-athlete is loving every moment of Paly sports. \r\n\r\n\"I don't know if I could just pick a favorite [sport],\" Frick said in a recent interview. \"My favorite is the one that I'm playing at the time during the season.\"\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_105043\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"335\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/11304157_1602089183371968_1945597461_n.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-105043\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/11304157_1602089183371968_1945597461_n.jpg\" alt=\"Frick participates in a summer softball tournament during 2013.

Photo by Jeff Frick.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe time management required to juggle high school academics and overlapping sports games and practices has always been a part of Frick's teenage lifestyle.\r\n\r\n\"I've been used to the timing [of playing multiple sports],\" Frick said. \"I did the same thing in middle school where I was playing a sport throughout every season, so I'm definitely used to the time management and doing homework when I have free time especially. It hasn't been that hard this year, and it definitely helps with managing my time.\"\r\n\r\nFrick began playing sports at an early age, beginning with basketball, and baseball as well, during kindergarten. According to Frick, she played little league baseball until fifth grade before switching over to softball in sixth grade, the year that she was introduced to water polo. Both of her older siblings, Andrew, a current freshman at Claremont McKenna College, and Maddie, a sophomore at Paly, have experience playing sports in high school. \r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_105027\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"393\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/11267042_10153408011083413_2787173618381490382_o.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-105027\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/11267042_10153408011083413_2787173618381490382_o.jpg\" alt=\"Frick began her playing career at a young age, participating in little league baseball in kindergarten before transferring to softball in sixth grade.

I also love the feeling of winning and making a team. I think it's really cool how teammates form and how close a team comes together.\"\r\n\r\nThroughout the year, Frick acted in a very mature manner for a freshman. Despite a minimal amount of playing time in certain sports, she maintained a positive attitude and focused more on team success, not just her own.\r\n\r\n\"The hardest part of this year was probably during basketball season when I did not play very often for stretches,\" Frick said. \"I got a\u00a0good amount of minutes during the regular season primarily, which I was very happy about. It was during practice when I would just try to continue to be a team player and not get down on myself or others as well.\"\r\n\r\nMany of Frick's teammates, including junior water polo player Katie Francis, acknowledged her outgoing personality and supportiveness, especially in practice.\r\n\r\n\"Sophie is very fun to be around and has a bubbly personality,\" Francis said. \"She is a very supportive teammate and pushes you hard in practice, which is good for the team.\"\r\n\r\nOther teammates expressed Frick's positivity and ability to get along with teammates easily. \r\n\r\n\"She is very supportive of all of us, especially bringing people up and our spirits up when we are down,\" freshman basketball guard Carly Leong said. \"She brings positivity by being the best teammate a person can have.\"\r\n\r\n\"She is super easy to get along with and is so friendly and outgoing that she fit right in with our team,\" junior Maddy Atwater said, a basketball and softball teammate of Frick's. \"She was a great teammate on the court and an even better friend off the court.\"\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_98904\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"711\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/IMG_8696.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-98904\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/IMG_8696.jpg\" alt=\"Frick warms up behind the three-point line prior to a game vs. Gunn High School.

It was nice to go in right after basketball and start right away, knowing that the coach trusted me and the team trusted me to do what I could as a freshman. It did mean a lot to start and bat in the middle of the order even with a lot of the older players on the team.\"\r\n\r\nWhen asked if Frick looked up to a particular teammate, the first name that came to mind was a basketball teammate, junior guard Courtney Lovely.\r\n\r\n\"Coco is an overall extremely positive, well-rounded person and obviously a very good basketball player too,\" Frick said.\r\n\r\nGiven her noteworthy talent, Frick says she hopes to play all three sports for as long as she can. While nothing can take away her hard-working, focused and caring attitude, Frick says that only the hectic nature of high school would prevent her from competing for\u00a0the\u00a0duration of all four years.\r\n\r\n\"As of right now, I am hoping to play for as long as I can; hopefully all four years,\" Frick said. \"I know that it gets busy as a junior with SATs and as a senior with college apps, so if I feel overwhelmed I will probably step out of one or two sports. That being said, I really hope I will continue to manage my time well enough so that I can play all three sports throughout high school.\"\r\n\r\nWhen she's not practicing or competing, Frick is passionate about music and television, especially when it involves her siblings.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_105040\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"189\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/11297661_1602089340038619_538719075_n.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-105040\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/11297661_1602089340038619_538719075_n.jpg\" alt=\"Frick protects the ball as she squeezes between defenders in a game against Mountain View.

I have a lot of shows that I'm always up to date with.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Frick, her primary goals for the next few years are to establish strong bonds with teammates. As for looking beyond her time at Paly, Frick says that playing in college would be a dream come true.\r\n\r\n\"I pursue sports for obviously the awesomeness of school legacy and to win championships and building teams that you'll remember for the rest of your life,\" Frick said. \"I would also love to play a sport in college if I ever get the opportunity. I think it would be really fun and really pursuing a dream.\"\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"After participating in water polo, basketball and softball during her first year in high school, freshman Sophie Frick looks poised for a number of athletic accomplishments in the near future, marking herself as the Paly Voice's athlete of the year.

The Paly Voice sat down with Palo Alto Unified School District Supt. Glenn \"Max\" McGee to discuss his rationale behind the decision to remove academic zero period.<\/em>\r\n\r\nThe Paly Voice: When and how did academic zero period start in this district?\r\n\r\nDr. Max McGee: It\u2019s been here for a while.\r\n\r\nPV: Do you know why Gunn has it, but Paly doesn\u2019t?\r\n\r\nMM: I think the schedule had something to do with it. Gunn had a more traditional schedule, with six classes every day, and because of that schedule, students wanted to have an F and G [fifth and sixth] period break later in the day.\r\n\r\nPV: Why do you think there are major differences in the scheduling and academic offerings at Paly and Gunn?\r\n\r\nMM: Those emerged over time, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good for our students or our community. I talked at the beginning of the year to all our teachers about the importance of being a collective community, not just a collection of autonomous communities. There\u2019s a balance \u2014 you need to maintain school autonomy and character \u2014 but when you have a common vision and more collaboration amongst schools, you get better ideas. I think we could build on ideas from both schools. There are things at Gunn that would benefit Paly students, and vice versa.\r\n\r\nPV: Out of the board members, parents, teachers and other community members, who has been most vocal in wanting to end it [zero period]?\r\n\r\nMM: First of all, it was an administrative decision, so it\u2019s my decision. And I think that\u2019s important because some people assume that it\u2019s a board decision, but it was my decision to do so ... I think one of the board members got the ball rolling on this \u2014 Mr. [Ken] Dauber was very interested in this \u2014 and we heard from several pediatricians. Frankly, the most vocal ones have been the pediatricians.\r\n\r\nPV: Where did you get your evidence to support your position? Did you actively look for studies about sleeping habits, or did you consult\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_105520\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"290\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/McGee.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-105520 \" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/McGee.png\" alt=\"PAUSD Superintendent Max McGee has made the executive decision to end academic zero period at Gunn.

Screenshot by Dhara Yu.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nwith students or teachers?\r\n\r\nMM: I did. I have a book called \"The Teenage Brain.\" It\u2019s really good. And that had information about sleep. And I heard from Dr. [Shashank] Joshi, who I deeply respect, and also Dr. [Steven] Adelsheim. These weren\u2019t just random scientists or doctors; these are people who I\u2019ve worked with, who I trust and who are really knowledgeable about this. I also talked with the faculty. Some of them supported the idea, but most of the them preferred the idea of student choice. I talked with students. I read Chloe Sorenson\u2019s survey end to end. Ms. Haas, the department chair of math, did a survey with 92 students and I read that. The survey asked \u2018Why do you want to take zero period?\u2019 and they responded, \u2018Because I want a break F and G period.\u2019 And that was the reason behind 80, 90 percent [of respondents]. The reason driving this was a need for a break. And why was there a need for a break? Because they had a more traditional schedule.\r\n\r\nPV: It [the zero period ban] is not something that pertains to everyone, yet it\u2019s such a focal issue for the Gunn students. What about it makes it such a big problem for them?\r\n\r\nMM: Well, two things. One, I think they\u2019re right about the student choice. Had we had more time, I would have liked to spend more time listening to the students and really having some serious dialogue. The fact of the matter is, we [the Board] have a lot of issues, one being the creative bell schedule, the report from the minority talent and achievement committee, next year\u2019s budget, multimillion dollar building projects, and frankly, I need to retain our focus on significant education issues. At some point, you need to make a decision and move on. I wish I had spent more time listening to students. Whether it would have changed the decision \u2014 maybe, maybe not \u2014 but one of the students actually said, \u2018I feel like we\u2019ve been heard. It\u2019s just human nature to think that if you tell people your opinion but it doesn\u2019t go your way, people feel that they haven\u2019t been heard.' I hate to disappoint people, but again for most people, this is the best decision. And part of the reason was to drive [Gunn\u2019s] schedule change.\r\n\r\nPV: When the first suicide happened in early November, was that when you first caught on to this idea of ending academic zero period?\r\n\r\nMM: I went to the student memorial for Cameron [Lee]...<strong>\u00a0<\/strong>and one of the students spoke about how you could videochat and text Cameron at any time at night; he was always there, whether it was two or four in the morning. He was such a great, gregarious person, and he really cared about others. She said that, and others repeated that theme. And that made me think of my own kids, one of whom slept with his computer by his bed \u2014 I could not get him out of bed in the morning \u2014 and I thought, sleep is involved in this somehow. It really made me think hard about the part that sleep deprivation plays in behaviors. Dr. Joshi, who investigates these deaths by suicide, and I had a conversation about that.\r\n\r\nPV: And then as the next Gunn suicide, and eventually the Paly suicide, happened, did this movement gain more traction?\r\n\r\nMM: Yes, it did. They both happened very early in the morning. I\u2019ve had the opportunity to talk with the parents of these students, which is just \u2014 it\u2019s hard to describe how badly I feel for them \u2014 and I have kids of my own. And it\u2019s hard to describe because we are all just so focused on our own lives and what matters to us. But as superintendent, as a leader, what matters to 4,000 high school students is more important than what matters to anyone individually.\r\n\r\nPV: There have been some rumors about the administration clamping down and preventing students from taking two academic classes in a certain subject, or putting a limit on Advanced Placement classes. Is this true?\r\n\r\nMM: Right now, we have a new sign off form required for if you take three or more AP classes. Basically it\u2019s a release. It says, \u2018taking too many APs can be hazardous to your mental health and wellbeing.\u2019 That\u2019s trivializing an important issue, but it\u2019s true; you\u2019re putting yourself at risk. We instituted that this year, but for right now, there\u2019s no discussion about limiting APs.\r\n\r\nPV: What would you say to the students at Gunn who are upset or disappointed by this decision?\r\n\r\nMM: First of all, I wish I had listened [to student voices] more. I wish that I had spent more time with them. But I did meet with a group of 25 students \u2014 not ASB, not SEC, just regular students \u2014 and we got some great ideas from them. I will commit to listening to them. But I did take their feedback and survey data into mind, and I made a decision, once again, that\u2019s the best decisions for the greatest number of students. I think the debate about zero period is essentially a schedule problem. It had really been a problem with the more traditional schedule at Gunn versus the block schedule at Paly.

Photo by Emma Chiu.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nNot knowing what to write in someone else's yearbook can be stressful and even awkward. If you\u2019re ever caught staring at a blank page, tapping your pen, you are likely to be perceived as an apathetic human being. Even if you truly are indifferent, out of general consideration you should still easily be able to contrive three sentences for someone (and yes, that\u2019s three sentences <i>minimum<\/i>)! If this sounds like a daunting task, here are the solutions for the most common types of people you will have to ponder:\r\n\r\n<b>1. The kid you've talked to once this entire year<\/b>\r\n\r\nWhen someone puts you in this position, it can feel a bit unfair of them and you may think that they don\u2019t deserve your time to write a message. However, chances are that this person is probably experiencing a bit of social anxiety and he or she, more than anyone, could use a nice sign-off. It\u2019s fine to give a generic compliment to this person, as long as you genuinely feel there's truth to in it! Example: \u201cIt was super fun having English with you this year. You always have really great things to say! Hope you have a fantastic summer :)\u201d\r\n\r\n<b>2. A friend you used to be a lot closer with than you are now<\/b>\r\n\r\nWhether it was just a regular falling out or a specific awkward event, we have all lost a certain level of closeness with some friends. It\u2019s fine to write about the good times you had with this person, even if they happened a while ago. Mention attributes of his or her character that you admire or accomplishments you know they will achieve in the future. If it\u2019s someone you want to strengthen your friendship with, then <i>express that<\/i>. If it\u2019s not, then <i>don\u2019t<\/i> - the most important thing to remember in this situation is to be both friendly and honest.\r\n\r\n<b>3. A solid homie<\/b>\r\n\r\nEven if you know a person well, you can still find yourself thinking \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say!\u201d How do you make it sound detailed yet not overdone, or funny yet sincere? An easy way to start is to talk about where you first met, and then go off about favorite memories from the past year (or anything from your K-12 history if you\u2019re a senior). Try to throw in an inside joke you guys have shared, and be sure to mention <i>why<\/i> you like being friends with this person anyway. If you can\u2019t think of anything, maybe that tells you something about your friendship.\r\n\r\n<b>4. That person you want to get with ;)<\/b>\r\n\r\nAgain, it\u2019s always good to talk about how you spent time together the past year. Mention how fun he or she is to be around or how much they make you laugh. Although a list of qualities shouldn\u2019t consist of the entire message, compliments are KEY. If you\u2019re feeling adventurous, you can list a bunch of adjectives and slip in the word \u201cpretty\u201d or \u201cattractive\". They\u2019ll definitely get the picture and if they\u2019ve ever been slightly interested in you, their desire to hit you up over the summer will definitely increase. If this risk sounds daunting, keep in mind that the worst that would happen is that the person you like will\u00a0be flattered but won\u2019t reciprocate feelings. Low risk, high reward!\r\n\r\n<b>5. Your best friend to whom no amount of writing could ever do justice<\/b>\r\n\r\nFor these types of people, you wonder, \u201cWhere do I even begin?!\u201d Sometimes it might feel hard because you\u2019ve written the same thing for them over the past 10 years in birthday cards, Christmas cards and let\u2019s not forget old yearbook signings. The thing to remember about this case is that you need to let go of the expectation that this yearbook signing has to be perfect. It doesn\u2019t have to flow well. It doesn\u2019t have to be the deepest thing you\u2019ve ever written to your friend. Feel free to combine all of the advice from the last four points. Just remember that your friend knows how awesome you are and no mediocre yearbook signing is going to change their positive perception of you.","excerpt":"Not knowing what to write in someone else's yearbook can be stressful and even awkward.
