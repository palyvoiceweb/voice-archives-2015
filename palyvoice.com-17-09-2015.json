[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Palo Alto High School Vikings football team (1-1, 0-0) fell to the San Benito Haybalers (2-0, 0-0) by a score of 49-34 last Friday in the second game of the season, a well-fought battle that was decided by a one-sided third quarter.\r\n\r\nAccording to senior quarterback Justin Hull, the Vikings played harder and performed better this year than they did in last year's game against San Benito, in which Paly lost 33-0.\r\n\r\n\u201cLast year we just got blown out by these guys, so it was nice to see a lot of effort across the board, offense and defense,\u201d Hull said.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings started the game off on a high note when Hull connected with senior wide receiver Riley Schoeben for a touchdown\u00a0in\u00a0the first 10 minutes. Immediately afterward, junior linebacker Jamie Cullen recovered a fumble on the Vikings\u2019 1-yard line, stalling a Haybalers' drive.\r\n\r\nSan Benito came back, however, with consecutive touchdowns scored by junior fullback Hunter Nye and senior running back Kyle Cameron.\r\n\r\nAlthough Paly senior fullback Shaun Pike tied up the game at the half with a touchdown less than 11 minutes into the third quarter, San Benito scored two back-to-back touchdowns in the same quarter. The Vikings' head coach Jake Halas accredited this to the Haybalers' wishbone offense, a formation that puts heavy pressure on the opposing team's defensive players. \r\n\r\n\u201cWe had a hard time shutting down that offense,\" Halas said. \"The wishbone offense hits very hard. We had some assignments blown, we couldn\u2019t really stop them.\u201d \r\n\r\nHowever, the Vikings didn\u2019t go down without a fight. Hull found receivers in the endzone multiple times during the second half, including a one-handed catch by\u00a0senior wideout Eli Givens.\r\n\r\nUltimately, San Benito\u2019s running game proved too much for the Vikings to handle.\r\n\r\n\"It was disappointing, but there\u2019s a lot that we can learn from it,\" Pike said. \"It\u2019s a good learning experience.\"\r\n\r\nThe Vikings' next game is against the Archbishop Mitty Monarchs (2-0,0-0) at 7 p.m. this upcoming Friday in San Jose.\r\n","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School Vikings football team (1-1, 0-0) fell to the San Benito Haybalers (2-0, 0-0) by a score of 49-34 last Friday, in the second game of the season, a well-fought battle that was decided by a one-sided third quarter.\r\n","date":"2015-09-15 17:58:33","author":"Jackson Doerr","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/rsz_2img_1239.jpg","categories":["Football","Sports","Sports Recap"],"tags":[]},{"id":108023,"title":"Liveblog: Girls&#8217; volleyball takes on Woodside in home opener","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/09\/15\/liveblog-girls-volleyball-takes-on-woodside-in-home-opener\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_108028\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/photo4.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-108028\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/photo4.jpg\" alt=\"The Vikings volleyball tea huddles before their game against Gunn on Sept. 23, 2014.

This includes opportunities such as <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/09\/14\/palo-alto-high-school-hosts-first-ever-yoga-on-the-quad-during-tutorial\/\">yoga on the Quad<\/a>, socializing, reading and meditating. Students can also continue to work on academic material.\r\n\r\nThe post also says that students will check in with their Tutorial teachers from 2:45 p.m. to 2:55 p.m. A warning bell will ring at 2:45 p.m. to remind students to check in.\r\n\r\nMath teacher Charlotte Harris understands the need for a new Tutorial attendance strategy.\r\n\r\n\u201cI believe that the administration wants students on campus taking use of this time, even if it\u2019s simply bonding with other people on campus,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThey want people to stay, so it makes sense to take it [attendance] at the end [of Tutorial].\u201d\r\n\r\nStudent reactions to the change in policy are mixed.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s kind of a hassle that we have to check in at the end now, but I can see why they\u2019re deciding to do it that way,\u201d senior Rachel van Gelder said. \u201cI know there are a lot of people who try to sneak out before Tutorial is over, so this will probably stop that from happening so often.\u201d\r\n\r\nJunior Jenny Zhuge is against the new approach to attendance.\r\n\r\n\u201cI just don\u2019t like that they [administration] made Tutorial mandatory for everyone,\u201d Zhuge said. \u201cIf you need help from teachers, then you should go and get help. But if you don\u2019t, and are just going to waste your time at school anyways, then might as well go home. For some people, going home and finishing work might be more productive than staying at school.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to junior Mackenzie Ferrell, Paly administration\u2019s regulation of Tutorial will be beneficial to students in ways that are not related to school work.\r\n\r\n\u201cTutorial is a great way to get help, but if you don\u2019t need to see a teacher you should be able to do fun things, and that is just what Paly administration is trying to do,\u201d Ferrell said. \u201cIt is a good time to socialize and get to know your teachers.\u201d\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Diorio mentions in the post that students must notify the school of a pre-planned absence before leaving during Tutorial, or risk being forced to stay.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you do need to leave campus, please have your parents contact the attendance office before Tutorial starts so you can pick up a pass to leave,\u201d Diorio said in her post. \u201cThe campus supervisors\/admin [administration] at the exits of school will ask to see the pass.\u201d","excerpt":"Attendance for Tutorial will be recorded from 2:45-2:55 p.m. to ensure that students stay for the entire length of the period starting tomorrow, according to a Schoology post by Principal Kim Diorio.","date":"2015-09-14 22:01:54","author":"Adrienne Kwok","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/DSCN03741.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"8458":"administration","53664":"attendance","39937":"change","53668":"charlotte","8644":"diorio","53665":"end of period","53667":"ferrell","53669":"harris","53672":"jenny","53666":"mackenzie","8944":"palo alto high school","8953":"paly","53671":"rachel","33850":"schoology","11060":"tutorial","53670":"van gelder","53673":"zhuge"}},{"id":107922,"title":"Paly hosts first ever &#8220;Yoga on the Quad&#8221; during Tutorial","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/09\/14\/palo-alto-high-school-hosts-first-ever-yoga-on-the-quad-during-tutorial\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_107923\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"950\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/11986473_10200509181809203_7819621335471777330_n.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-107923\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/11986473_10200509181809203_7819621335471777330_n.jpg\" alt=\"A sign advertising the new event during tutorial where students are invited to participate in a yoga class on the quad called &quot;Yoga on the Quad.&quot; Photo: &quot;Paly on the quad&quot; Facebook group. \" width=\"950\" height=\"582\" \/><\/a> A sign advertising the new event during Tutorial where students are invited to participate in a yoga class on the Quad taught by yoga instructor Lisa Haley.

At Palo Alto High School, however, 40 students were given the opportunity\u00a0to work with alumnus James Franco to become acquainted with his knowledge of film. The first of eight James Franco-led film workshops took place from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. today in the Media Arts Center.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/09\/07\/james-franco-to-teach-film-course-in-mac\/\" target=\"_blank\">After considering approximately 500 applicants<\/a>, the leaders of the workshop selected students from Palo Alto High School, Gunn High School, Menlo School and Los Altos High School on Sept. 12, a day prior to the first workshop.\r\n\r\nStudents were first introduced to their assignment for the year: to film certain scenes in groups from the screenplay \u201cMetamorphosis: Junior Year\u201d by Amber Cony, based on the <a href=\"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/about\/Metamorphosis.html?id=p0Y9oImKJQsC&amp;hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">novel and stage play<\/a>\u00a0by James Franco's mother, Betsy Franco. At the end of the year, the groups will unify each of their respective scenes into one film, to eventually be submitted to the <a href=\"http:\/\/cinequest.org\/film-festival\" target=\"_blank\">Cinequest Film Festival<\/a> in San Jose.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay follows the life of a teenager, Ovid, and his everyday interactions with his friends, whether it be the poet, filmmaker or cyber-couple. Carrying his own painful secret, Ovid transcribes his confessions into his notebook, while maintaining a strong passion for art and modern-day Roman mythology references.\r\n\r\nAfter introductions, participants were assigned mock roles for a live reading of the script, which soon generated discussion of what students wanted to change, add or manipulate to the screenplay.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe got to listen to all the different voices,\u201d Menlo sophomore Ari Troper said.\r\n\r\nStudents were then split into permanent eight groups of five, with each group in charge of filming particular characters and scenes. Among each of the five participants, students assigned themselves a specific job of either director, producer, cinematographer, writer or editor.\r\n\r\nJames Franco ended the workshop with a live commentary of \u201cThe Myth of an American Teenager,\u201d a coming-of-age movie with a similar theme to \u201cMetamorphosis: Junior Year.\u201d\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_107862\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"445\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/0-4.jpeg\"><img class=\"wp-image-107862\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/0-4.jpeg\" alt=\"0-4\" width=\"445\" height=\"298\" \/><\/a> Esther Wojcicki (right) greets James Franco (left) in front of the Media Arts Center as students arrive in the morning.

Learning is what he is all about. I think this is his way of giving back.\u201d","excerpt":"The first of eight James Franco-led film workshops took place from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. in the Media Arts Center today.","date":"2015-09-13 20:14:47","author":"Morgan Keller","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/0-5.jpeg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"29838":"alumnus","53632":"Betsy","53630":"conquest","53629":"eight","53636":"esther","8703":"festival","8706":"film","29992":"franco","8751":"gunn","10749":"high school","29991":"james","8801":"james franco","53634":"junior year","9849":"los altos","17729":"Menlo","53635":"metamorphosis","53638":"myth of american teenager","53637":"myth of american teenagr","8939":"palo alto","8944":"palo alto high school","8953":"paly","10117":"san jose","53633":"screenplay","53631":"Tom","12702":"wojcicki","29088":"workshop"}}]
