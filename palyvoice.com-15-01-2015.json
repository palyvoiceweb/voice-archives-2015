If selected, Foothill will implement\u00a0a cheaper and larger dental hygiene program than its\u00a0current two-year program. Photo by Milena Maese-Czeropski.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"color: #373e4d;\">Foothill College is currently striving to introduce a low-cost bachelor's degree program after the bill SB 850 went into effect Jan. 1, which gives community colleges affordable alternatives to programs that public California universities offer.<\/span>\r\n\r\nAccording to the <a href=\"http:\/\/leginfo.legislature.ca.gov\/faces\/billAnalysisClient.xhtml\">Legislative Counsel of California<\/a>, the implemented bill gives\u00a015 California community colleges the opportunity to launch a bachelor's degree program in a specific major that meets local workforce demands and that does not compete with or duplicate programs offered at University of California or California State University schools. 34 community colleges are competing for the 15 spots\u00a0offered in the bill, which was initially approved by Gov. Jerry Brown in September 2014.\r\n\r\nAccording to Foothill's Dental Hygiene Program Director Phyllis Spragge, if Foothill is one of the 15 community colleges chosen to offer a bachelor's degree program, administrators will create their first four-year dental hygiene program. Andrea Hanstein, Foothill director of marketing and public relations, said Foothill would implement this pilot program by 2016.\r\n\r\nThe state chancellor\u2019s office will judge the colleges\u2019 proposals and consult with UC and CSU schools to decide the chosen 15 community colleges. According to California's Legislative Counsel, the accepted colleges will only initially be able to offer one program, which will have to pass through the Accrediting Commission for Community and Junior Colleges and find a method of payment for the program.\r\n\r\nAccording to Palo Alto High School college advisor Sandra Cernobori, on average, 12 to 15 percent of Paly seniors apply to Foothill each year. If created, the dental hygiene program would provide Paly graduates the opportunity to enroll in a baccalaureate degree at Foothill for the first time.\r\n\r\nSenior Grete Saue is planning to go to Foothill and would consider\u00a0the new program.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think it's a good idea,\u201d Saue said. \u201cIt opens up new opportunities for people who may not have the money, want to stay local or even need to spend the extra money that universities require.\u201d\r\n\r\nCurrently no UC or CSU university teaches dental hygiene, and the course is only available through three private universities in California. The cost of tuition for the program at these private colleges ranges from $43,000 to $70,000 per year. If Foothill is granted the opportunity to create this program, it will be offered at rates significantly lower than those of private universities, according to Spragge.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe tuition for the pilot program baccalaureate degree programs will be higher than the usual community college fees, but lower than CSU or UC fees,\u201d Spragge said. \u201cIt is estimated that a bachelor\u2019s degree under this pilot program could cost about $10,000.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Spragge, Foothill chose the dental hygiene program due to the vitality of dental hygiene in the job market, the need for dental hygiene care in California and the strength of Foothill\u2019s current dental hygiene program. According to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.foothill.edu\/bio\/programs\/dentalh\/\">Foothill College\u2019s website<\/a>, its dental hygiene program has led to consistent rankings as one of the top 10 community colleges in the United States for dental hygiene. Its website says that its current two-year dental hygiene program includes curriculum that covers the basic sciences, oral anatomy, public health, nutrition, clinical dental hygiene, periodontics and radiology.\r\n\r\nAn average of 100 students apply each year for 24 spots in the current program, according to Spragge. However, the competition for a spot in the program would be lessened with the addition of a four-year program.\r\n\r\n\"Even though we only take 24 students a year, we're looking at this bachelor degree program to be larger in number and in scope,\" Spragge said.\r\n\r\nThe employment rate in the dental hygiene field is presumed to grow by 38 percent through 2020, significantly faster than other occupations, according to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bls.gov\/oes\/current\/oes292021.htm\">U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics<\/a>. This growth is attributed to an increased demand for dental care and a greater use of dental hygienists.\r\n\r\nFor more information about Foothill's current dental hygiene program, you can visit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.foothill.edu\/bio\/programs\/dentalh\/\">Foothill's official site<\/a>.","excerpt":"Foothill College is one of dozens of community colleges striving to introduce a low-cost bachelor degree program as an affordable alternative to those that traditional California Public Universities offer.","date":"2015-01-13 21:44:12","author":"Adele Bloch","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/unnamed.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"34667":"bachelor degree program","8552":"California","34668":"community college","34669":"Foothill","8715":"Foothill College"}},{"id":95728,"title":"&#8216;Save the 2008&#8242; to push school board tonight","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/01\/13\/save-the-2008-to-push-school-board-tonight\/","content":"<div style=\"color: #000000;\">\r\n\r\nMembers of a campaign organized by a Gunn High School student and former teacher will again bring their movement for a less stressful academic environment at\u00a0tonight's School Board meeting's open forum session at 6:30 p.m. at the Palo Alto Unified School District office.\r\n\r\nThe campaign, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.savethe2008.com\">'Save the 2,008'<\/a>, was\u00a0created by Gunn sophomore Martha Cabot and former teacher Marc Vicenti in reaction to the suicide of a Gunn student last year.

Using the phrase \u201cJe suis Charlie\u201d is <b>not<\/b> an agreement with Charlie Hebdo's statements and images that blatantly disrespect the beliefs of Islam. (It is also not intended to imply that I speak French.) \u201cJe suis Charlie\u201d is a symbol of supporting freedom of the press and showing no fear to those who attempt to stifle that freedom.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we\u2019ve seen too often how tragic events spark protests and strong trends on social media, but after several weeks, or even days, the interest quickly fades \u2014 a point eloquently <a href=\"http:\/\/verdemagazine.com\/thats-what-shi-said-well-that-was-fast-society-has-a-goldfish-attention-span-when-it-comes-to-activism\">made<\/a> by fellow Palo Alto High School journalist Kelly Shi in the most recent issue of Verde Magazine. Just look at how 58 percent of Americans supported stricter gun control laws just after the Newtown shootings in 2012, but by October 2014, that support had fallen to 47 percent, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gallup.com\/poll\/179045\/less-half-americans-support-stricter-gun-laws.aspx\">surveys<\/a> conducted by Gallup Poll.\r\n\r\nSo, this new column is my long-term commitment to supporting freedom of the press by discussing controversial topics that relate to high school students and expressing my possibly unpopular opinions.\r\n\r\nRight now, the public has been strongly urging\u00a0journalists to push the envelope when it comes to controversy and show that we are not afraid to exercise our rights.\u00a0However, this movement collides with the common journalistic principle that\u00a0\u201cjust because you <i>can<\/i> say something doesn\u2019t mean you <i>should.<\/i>\u201d In my opinion,\u00a0there is a problem\u00a0in writing with the intent to offend (as\u00a0Charlie Hebdo\u00a0seems to have done), but there is still a power in writing with the intent to provoke.\r\n\r\nWhat can you expect from this column? Well since the words \u201chigh school\u201d and \u201ccontroversy\u201d are so often seen together, you can expect almost anything. I intend to\u00a0reveal my unconventional thoughts on people applying to over 20 colleges, worshiping <span style=\"color: #222222;\">Beyonc\u00e9<\/span>\u00a0as a goddess and\/or watching a \u201ctrash\u201d reality show like \u201cThe Bachelor.\u201d I want to address hook-up culture, upperclassmen entitlement and stigmas that come from labels.\r\n\r\nI often\u00a0like to use statistics but at the same time add a little sass or sarcasm. Some pieces may be more serious or light-hearted than others. One thing I can guarantee though: sugar-coating gets checked at the door.\r\n\r\nThis project will be a column and not a collection of separate opinion pieces for a reason: the phrase \u201cJe suis Emma\u201d will appear in each new column to serve as an ongoing reminder of last week\u2019s overflowing support for freedom of the press, as well as a way to honor those who were killed for exercising their rights. With the title \"Je suis Emma,\" I hope to emphasize that both writing and reading these pieces are in themselves support of that freedom.\r\n\r\nJe suis Charlie. Je suis Emma.","excerpt":"This new column is my long-term commitment to supporting freedom of the press by discussing controversial topics that relate to high school students and expressing my possibly unpopular opinions.
