We have play-offs coming up and so we need to do well in our league tournament to move on to CCS [Central Coast Section playoffs]. I'm looking forward to throwing up some low scores in the coming weeks.\"\r\n\r\nTwo of the standout stars on the team this season have been freshmen Ahmed Ali and Joonsung Ha, both of whom posted team-best scores of 35 in the recent rivalry match against Gunn High School. According to Ha, despite his individual success this season, his main goal is still to contribute to the team however possible.\r\n\r\n\"The goal for me is to try to get to NorCals [the individual competition for top Northern California players],\" Ha said. \"[However,] I think my role in the team is to just play the best I possibly can. It's a great experience playing on a team because golf is an individual sport. I hope that our team can win the SCVAL \u00a0[league] tournament and I hope that I can [consistently] shoot even par.\"\r\n\r\nThe other senior captain, Alex Hwang, added that the team still has an eager eye on the upcoming CCS tournament.\r\n\r\n\"We're doing super well and haven't lost a match yet, but everyone knows our real competition comes at CCS,\" Hwang said. \"Our goal is to advance past CCS, which we haven't done in a long time.\"\r\n\r\nThe first SCVAL tournament match will be played against Los Gatos High School, Saratoga High School, and Gunn at 12:30 p.m. today at Santa Teresa Golf Course in San Jose.","excerpt":"After a strong league campaign in which the Palo Alto High School boys\u2019 golf team finished in first place, the team prepares for the upcoming Santa Clara Valley Athletic League tournament with great expectations.","date":"2015-04-28 15:23:08","author":"Wesley Woo","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/golf3.jpg","categories":["Golf"],"tags":{"14524":"alex hwang","8738":"Golf","14526":"john knowles","42418":"joonsung ha","42421":"norcals","42420":"norcals golf","14521":"paly golf","9078":"scval","42419":"scval golf"}},{"id":102828,"title":"Tuesday Tunes: Tessa Barry","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/04\/28\/tuesday-tunes-tessa-barry\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_102830\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"321\"]<img class=\" wp-image-102830\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/11163698_1086355508047912_1189178134_o.jpg\" alt=\"Junior Tessa Barry shares her favorite songs with The Paly Voice.

Of the 30 juniors scheduled to take the test in the room, only 15 were present. Photo by Jeanette Wong.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nUnder 50\u00a0percent of Palo Alto High School juniors took the state-standardized Smarter Balanced test today, according to Dean of Students Adam Paulson.\r\n\r\nAccording to California Education Code \u00a760615, parents are allowed to let their children opt out of California standardized tests, such as the Smarter Balanced test, by simply\u00a0signing a form. However, Paulson said students who were not previously excused from the test are expected to retake the test at a\u00a0to-be-determined date.\r\n\r\n\u201cOur participation rate was expected to be somewhere around 50 percent \u2014 which is disappointing,\u201d Principal Kim Diorio said. \u201cWe were hoping for a larger turnout, but we certainly understand that parents and students have a right to opt out of these kinds of tests. We\u2019re seeing a trend across the nation of parents and students exercising that right.\u201d\r\n\r\nGiven the small number of test takers, the data collected may not accurately reflect the proficiency of the junior class on the\u00a0subjects that were tested. With less than 50 percent of students taking the Smarter Balanced test, the data is statistically insignificant, which does not accurately give\u00a0the school benchmark information, Diorio said.\r\n\r\nBecause\u00a0it is Paly\u2019s first year for implementing the Smarter Balanced test, the school and\u00a0the school district will not be affected by the scores in any way, according to Diorio. However, Smarter Balanced scores next year will count towards the school\u2019s \u2018score,\u2019 which will be a reconstituted version of the Academic Performance Index score, Paulson said. Thus, Paly\u2019s score next year will depend on test participation.\r\n\r\n\u201cTypically, it\u2019s around 95 percent of the students that they [the CA Dept. of Education] want you [the school] to test,\u201d Paulson said. \u201cObviously, today we didn\u2019t get there. We need most kids to participate so we can get an accurate score.\u201d\r\n\r\nDespite how test participation did not fulfill ideal circumstances, the school benefitted from the test administered today, according to\u00a0Diorio.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good practice run,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cI think teachers will learn a lot from proctoring it and administering it. Having seen the questions and getting a better sense of what it\u2019s asking students, there\u2019s definitely value in it.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe test is divided into two sections, with a 10-minute break in between the sections. Some changes were made today regarding the scheduled breaks during the test.\r\n\r\nStudents were given two hours to complete around five short answer questions, according to junior Joseph Kao. Kao says many students\u00a0completed the first section of the test in approximately 15 to 30 minutes. Because the test took a shorter amount of time than anticipated, Diorio and Paulson released students about an hour before their scheduled break time.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe did not expect that [the length of the test], which is why we made the executive decision to let you [the students] out,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cI walked around to five or six classrooms and I noticed that everybody was done. I found Mr. Paulson, and we decided to make some adjustments and give the students a break. We don\u2019t want you sitting there with an hour, or hour and a half, with nothing to do. That\u2019s not fair to the kids who did show up.\u201d\r\n\r\nPublic school participation in the Smarter Balanced test is encouraged by the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cde.ca.gov\/ta\/tg\/sa\/index.asp\">California Department of Education<\/a>, according to Paulson.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs a public school, we need to offer the tests, and we encourage full participation,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cI\u2019m very thankful for all the kids that are here. It will help us get some good data.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlthough the Smarter Balanced test <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/04\/26\/smarter-balanced-scores-to-waive-placement-tests\/\">does not help with admission to college<\/a>, it can potentially save students time by acting as a placement test for colleges in the California State University system and community college system.\r\n\r\nMany students did not show up to take the test because they felt it had no meaningful purpose, according to junior Nick Guardino.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think a lot of people didn\u2019t come because it [the Smarter Balanced test] doesn\u2019t necessarily affect their future,\u201d Guardino said. \u201cThey probably didn\u2019t think it was worth their time. \u2026 It\u2019s monotonous and seems irrelevant.\u201d","excerpt":"Under 50 percent of Palo Alto High School juniors took the state-standardized Smarter Balanced test today, according to Dean of Students Adam Paulson.","date":"2015-04-27 17:25:44","author":"Jeanette Wong","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Screen-Shot-2015-04-27-at-4.26.04-PM.png","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"42410":"boycott","8644":"diorio","9760":"juniors","42414":"participation","42411":"paulson","42413":"show up","42405":"smarter balanced","42412":"standardized","12319":"test"}},{"id":102191,"title":"ASB is Sirius about Hogwarts Week","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/04\/27\/asb-is-sirius-about-hogwarts-week\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_102458\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"457\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/799961388_83de46731f_o.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-102458\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/799961388_83de46731f_o.jpg\" alt=\"The various Hogwarts houses within the Harry Potter Series.

After a humiliating drunk video of their friend was posted, they anonymously took part in cyberbullying her\u00a0by posting malicious comments on the video, eventually resulting in her suicide.

Photo courtesy of MTV.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe message the film is trying to convey is clear: Be careful of what you post on the Internet because your digital footprint lasts forever. In an era where social media dominates much of teenagers' lives, this message is essential. Screenwriter Nelson Greaves\u2019s decision to set the entire film on\u00a0the protagonist\u2019s laptop creates a hauntingly real environment. No longer are the horror movie victims targeted by a possessed porcelain doll or trapped in a haunted house \u2014 the horror of \u201cUnfriended\u201d lies directly on the familiar pages of YouTube, Facebook and Instagram.\r\n\r\nViewers literally see the plot unfold through the eyes of the protagonist. Every Facebook or Skype notification she gets, every song she listens to on Spotify, every message she types out but deletes before sending is\u00a0exposed to the audience. This new, unfamiliar sense of intimacy between the individuals on either sides of the screen is unlike any other.\r\n\r\nDespite its clever concept, the film fails to deliver a satisfying overall experience. The trailer, although brilliantly made, essentially spoils the entire movie. The plot becomes predictable, and as a result, it\u2019s a bit boring at parts. Much like many other thrillers, the storyline isn't particularly complex. However, the frightening aspect of the other movies often counteracts\u00a0their dull plots, making them\u00a0enjoyable to watch.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Q72LWqCx3pc\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\n<em>Featuring clips from viral YouTube videos, the \"Unfriended\" trailer presents a summary of the movie's plot.<\/em>\r\n\r\nIn this movie, the hinted scariness from the trailer is barely present in the film itself. With the age-old what\u2019s-behind-the-closet-door question replaced with what\u2019s-in-the-jpeg-image-I-just-received and the classic, chilling telephone ring replaced with the feeble ping of an unknown notification, the spook factor of \u201cUnfriended\u201d is minimal at best. There are several jump scares scattered throughout, but don\u2019t count on this to be your new favorite horror movie.\r\n\r\nThat being said, the writing isn\u2019t all bad. The considerably static plot is interlaced with jokes that are sure to make you laugh out loud. The humor is well-suited for high school students, and the dynamic of the on-screen teenagers is much like that of an\u00a0average friend group. As a whole, the film offers decent entertainment and should not be missed by those who wish to have a good laugh.\r\n\r\nAlthough \u201cUnfriended\u201d may not be one of the best movies of the year, it most certainly deserves to be remembered as a timely snapshot of the 21st century.\r\n\r\n<strong>\u201cUnfriended\u201d<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>1 hour, 23 minutes<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Rated R for violent content, pervasive language, some sexuality, and drug and alcohol use \u2014\u00a0all involving teens<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Directed by Levan Gabriadze<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Starring Shelley Henning, Moses Jacob Storm, Renee Olstead, Courtney Halverson<\/strong>","excerpt":"Simultaneously innovative and unengaging, \u201cUnfriended\u201d delivers an adequate performance that serves more as a tacky teenage movie with a message than as a blood-curdling thriller.","date":"2015-04-26 17:55:39","author":"Jeanette Wong","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/1.jpg","categories":["A&amp;E Section Spotlight","Entertainment","Reviews","Spotlight"],"tags":{"8689":"Facebook","30939":"instagram","8900":"movie review","42389":"scary movie","42388":"skype","30938":"social media","42390":"spotify","42387":"unfriended","11976":"youtube"}},{"id":102771,"title":"Smarter Balanced scores to waive placement tests","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/04\/26\/smarter-balanced-scores-to-waive-placement-tests\/","content":"Juniors will take their first-ever official state-standardized Smarter Balanced test on Monday and Tuesday at Palo Alto High School.

Screenshot by Emily Hwang.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAccording to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.smarterbalanced.org\/news\/close-200-colleges-universities-use-smarter-balanced-scores-part-placement\/\">Smarter Balanced website<\/a>, 101 California schools will be accepting Smarter Balanced scores to waive placement test requirements. However, the scores will solely\u00a0be used by colleges in the California State University (CSU) system and community college system, not the University of California (UC) system.\r\n\r\nAccording to college counselor Sandra Cernobori, the Smarter Balanced scores are not used for admission into colleges. Rather, they are exclusively utilized by state colleges and universities so that students do not have to take placement tests once they are accepted into a CSU or community college.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Smarter Balanced has nothing to do with getting in [to college],\u201d Cernobori said. \u201cIt\u2019s having to do with whether or not they [students] need to take a placement test after they\u2019ve been admitted, or if their scores on either the SAT or ACT or on the Smarter Balanced have waived that requirement.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Cernobori, there is a section\u00a0on the test where students can indicate whether they want their Smarter Balanced scores to replace traditional placement test scores.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s a bubble that you fill in on the test sheet that says that you would like these [the test scores] to also be considered for this other purpose [placement in college courses],\u201d Cernobori said.\r\n\r\nCernobori says that allowing colleges to look at Smarter Balanced\u00a0scores for placement purposes will probably most likely not make much difference to most students. However, according to Cernobori, it would save them time if students\u00a0end up attending a CSU or community college.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt might be an advantage after they\u2019re admitted in terms of waiving the placement test,\u201d Cernobori said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to lose, there\u2019s not a ton to gain, but there\u2019s a little bit to gain, so might as well bubble it in.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe test is being used so that students can have more variety with\u00a0placement test scores at colleges.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a different kind of test, so sometimes they do better on it [the Smarter Balanced exam],\u201d Cernobori said.\r\n\r\nAccording to Cernobori, this option has existed before, except with a different exam (Standardized Testing and Reporting program, or STAR Test).\r\n\r\nJunior Neta Hart says she might indicate that she wants her scores on the Smarter Balanced to be used for placement. However, she is not concerned about her scores on the test.\r\n\r\n\u201cI focus more on the ACT,\u201d Hart said. \u201c I know that most colleges will look at the ACT, not the Smarter Balanced test. \u2026 I only knew about this test two days ago.\u201d\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"Juniors will take their first-ever official state-standardized Smarter Balanced test on Monday and Tuesday at Palo Alto High School.

While Zero Period PE is not responsible for a large percentage of these numbers, running the mile at 7:15 a.m. is sure to drain already sleep-deprived youth and can lead to even greater health risks. According to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.apa.org\/monitor\/oct01\/sleepteen.aspx\">American Psychological Association<\/a>, research suggests that sleep deprivation puts adolescents at risk for cognitive and emotional difficulties, poor school performance, accidents and psychopathology.\r\n\r\nSleep deprivation can lead to other negative side effects. It\u00a0can cause aggressive behavior and contribute to illnesses, according to the Sleep Foundation. According to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aap.org\/en-us\/about-the-aap\/aap-press-room\/aap-press-room-media-center\/Pages\/Sleepy-Teens.aspx\">American Academy of Pediatrics<\/a>, the risk of depression significantly increased among teens who sleep less than eight hours a night. While one may state that students enrolled in Zero Period PE try to sleep earlier in compensation, no surveys or studies regarding this exist and hordes of Paly students continue to lament their lack of sleep.\r\n\r\nWhile self-identified \u201cmorning people\u201d may benefit from Zero Period PE, many sophomores take the class to enroll in as many as eight other academic classes during the school day. Although freshmen are <a href=\"http:\/\/paly.net\/sites\/default\/files\/2015-16_gr9_course_selection_form_front%26back.pdf\">prohibited<\/a> from joining more than seven classes, no limit exists for sophomores and upperclassmen.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt forces people who want to take many classes into taking Zero Period [PE] because it [taking many classes] is not an option otherwise,\u201d sophomore Julia Lauer said.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, morning people can still wake up early to complete school assignments, and thus do not need to take an early class to be productive.\r\n\r\nAccording to sophomore Jessica Wu, who signed up for nine classes in first semester, Zero Period PE contributed to an already high stress load.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was a super long day,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d arrive [at school] at seven and go home at five with no break. Then I would have extracurriculars, and that would give me no time to actually get work done until nine.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlthough Zero Period PE may cause less stress than early academic classes, it continues to strain students\u2019 stress and sleep levels. However, supporters maintain that because Zero Period PE is an optional class, it should always be available to those who wish to take it. In order to cooperate with students willing to wake in the early morning in exchange for an afternoon prep, an ideal solution is\u00a0to limit Zero Period students to a total of seven classes or make students who wish to take more that seven classes sign a waiver. In addition, advisers and counselors should warn against utilizing Zero Period PE as a tool for taking extra classes.","excerpt":"Zero Period Physical Education classes need reform in order to limit student stress and decrease sleep deprivation.\r\n","date":"2015-04-23 14:42:41","author":"Aidan Maese-Czeropski","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/ZEROPERIOD.jpg","categories":["Opinion"],"tags":{"8638":"debate","8751":"gunn","32445":"max mcgee","8927":"opinion","8944":"palo alto high school","8953":"paly","8980":"pe","9106":"sleep","9128":"Stress","42273":"zero period","42382":"zero period pe"}}]
