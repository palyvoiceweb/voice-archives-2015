The Magical Bridge Playground drew a large crowd during its grand opening on April 18 at Mitchell Park and included performances by differently abled children on the community stage.\r\n\r\nAccording to Jill Asher, co-creator of the playground, outdoor play is an essential way for young children to develop gross motor skills and to form friendships.\r\n\r\nThe idea began when Olenka Villarreal, a Palo Alto mom, could not take her child with special needs to any of the 34 parks in Palo Alto. Instead, Villarreal was forced to spend $150 an hour on a round-trip to San Jose so that her daughter could simply swing on a special swing set, Asher said.\r\n\r\nDespite Villarreal's complaints to the City of Palo Alto regarding the lack of inclusivity in the city parks, all city parks were compliant with the requirements of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ada.gov\/\">Americans with Disabilities Act.<\/a> An ADA-compliant park gives differently abled children the ability to enter the park, but not necessarily the ability to play in it. Villarreal soon decided to make matters into her own hands.\r\n\r\nAfter six years of extensive planning and nine months of building, Villarreal utilized $4 million raised through fundraising and the $300,000 given by the City of Palo Alto to finally turn her dream into a reality.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt truly is a playground for everybody regardless of physical and cognitive disabilities or abilities,\u201d Asher said.\r\n\r\nAccording to Nick Peterson, head contractor of the project, the park is separated into seven different zones: the kindness corner, picnic\/playhouse zone, slide zone, music zone, swinging\/sway zone, spinning zone and tot zone.\r\n\r\nAccording to Peterson, the inclusion experts and contractors have been working hard to make sure every structure and surface is inclusive to all cognitive and physical disabilities. For example, every inch of the park is covered in a special surface that is wheelchair-friendly, making it easier for all children to get around the park.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_102943\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"215\"]<img class=\"wp-image-102943\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/11185441_840578059351617_467290310_n.jpg\" alt=\"11185441_840578059351617_467290310_n\" width=\"215\" height=\"287\" \/> This is one of the 'magical bridges' in the Magical Bridge park.

What the Paly community may not always take the time to consider, however, is where the funding to provide these readily available resources comes from. On May 5, voters of the Palo Alto Unified\u00a0School District will determine the fate of Measure A, a raise in parcel tax that would\u00a0increase funding for the Palo Alto education system.\r\n\r\nThe Paly Voice presents the Measure A controversy in five minutes or less.\r\n\r\n<b>What is the parcel tax?<\/b>\r\n\r\nA\u00a0parcel tax is a tax assessed against each unit or \u201cparcel\u201d of taxable land in a district. Palo Alto\u2019s parcel tax is on a six-year cycle designed to ensure that the community is supporting the Palo Alto Unified School District\u2019s current programs, goals for class size reduction and staff salaries. According to the school board's\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/pausd.org\/community\/MeasureA\/downloads\/2015ParcelTaxRenewalResolution_012715.pdf\">2015 Parcel Tax Renewal Resolution<\/a>, the last parcel tax, passed on May 4, 2010, was an assessment of $589 per parcel with an annual two percent escalation. In January, the PAUSD school board decided to add Measure A,\u00a0which will increase the current parcel tax to $758 per parcel, on a special May ballot.\r\n\r\n<b>What are the issues at stake?<\/b>\r\n\r\nThe district\u2019s financial stability will be impacted by voters\u2019 decision on the proposed increase of\u00a0parcel tax. Supporters of the $120 increase claim that PAUSD needs the extra money because state and local governments cannot provide sufficient unrestricted funding.\r\n\r\nAccording to a poll conducted by the school board, 79 percent of voters felt that the most important use of the potential revenue produced from the parcel tax is \u201cadding support staff to help at-risk students who are struggling with the basics.\u201d\r\n\r\n<b>Why are people divided on this issue?<\/b>\r\n\r\nThe high tax vs. low tax issue is not a new point of political and economic contention. However, this time, Measure A is in jeopardy after the school board made certain decisions to reduce student stress, which faced great scrutiny from the public. A <a href=\"http:\/\/www.paloaltoonline.com\/news\/2015\/04\/24\/battle-over-measure-a-heats-up\">Palo Alto Online article<\/a>\u00a0cited\u00a0parents who\u00a0voted against\u00a0the measure in hopes of sending a dissatisfied message to\u00a0the district and school administration, as they believe there have not been sufficient fiscal resources spent ensuring stable\u00a0mental health amongst students. They disagree with the idea of pouring more money into what they argue is a failing system.\u00a0Supporters of the tax counter this argument by claiming that there is no way emotional health initiatives will strengthen without additional funding.\r\n\r\nIn addition, opponents of Measure A may include the demographic of citizens of Palo Alto who do not have students enrolled in the education system, who would not directly benefit from the increase in parcel tax revenue.\r\n\r\n<b>How do you vote?<\/b>\r\n\r\nBallots can be returned by mail using a purple postage-paid return envelope included in the ballot packet. The registrar encourages voters to return their ballots as soon as possible, so that there is enough time to receive all eligible ballots by Election Day. Ballots that are returned in-person must be received by 8 p.m. on May 5. Ballots returned by mail must be postmarked on or before Election Day and must be received by Friday, May 8 (three days after the election).","excerpt":"On May 5, voters of the Palo Alto Unified School District will determine the fate of Measure A, a raise in parcel tax that would increase funding for the Palo Alto education system.

Slaney finished with a 4:37.48 time.\r\n\r\nYoung talent such as sophomore Thorin Haussecker, who earned a personal record in the 200- meter race and is ranked 13th in the De Anza League, is looking forward to the opportunity of running varsity next season.\r\n\r\n\u201cI'm looking forward to racing varsity next year especially in the 4x100 meter race with some of the other great sprinters and I'm going to do a lot of training in the off season to make sure I'm in shape once next year\u2019s season begins,\u201d Haussecker said.\r\n\r\nDespite the regular season being over and the loss to Lynbrook, the Vikings have their heads held high and many are looking forward to De Anza League trials at 3:15 p.m. next Tuesday, May 5 at Lynbrook High School. The Vikings, along with the other schools in DAL will send their three best athletes for each event to the meet for a chance to earn a qualifying spot in the De Anza League finals, which will occur on Thursday, May 7, again at Lynbrook.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School boys\u2019 track and field team is looking forward to the De Anza League meets next week after a close loss against Lynbrook High School on Thursday.

Paly ASB assigned a Hogwarts house to each class with seniors as Gryffindor, juniors as Slytherin, sophomores as Ravenclaw and freshmen as Hufflepuff. Students generally enjoyed the new Hogwarts Week and its \u00a0events.\r\n\r\n\"Hogwarts Week was super fun,\" senior Sonty Visuthikraisee said. \"I especially liked the first day where we got to dress up and show off all our Hogwarts spirit.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to senior Maeve Lavelle, the activities also provided an opportunity for classes to bond.\r\n\r\n\"I think that Hogwarts Week was a great way for each class to bond before the end of the year,\" Lavelle said.\r\n\r\nHogwarts week was also successful from an ASB standpoint in terms of student participation in all events.\r\n\r\n\"I think that Hogwarts week went really, really well,\" Sophomore Vice President Anmol Nagar said. \"So many people were able to be involved in the Triwizard Tournament, trivia and Quidditch games.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the three events, the Quidditch event, held during Lunch of Thursday and Friday, was the most popular.\r\n\r\nSenior Anna Dukovic enjoyed participating in the new activity.\r\n\r\n\"It was fun to try something new [Quidditch] and do something with our class again outside of Spirit Week,\" Dukovic said.\r\n\r\nASB is sponsoring another event during the week of May 18 called Sports Fest, which will replace the annual powderpuff football.\r\n\r\n\"Hogwarts Week is actually not a replacement for powderpuff,\" Nagar said. \"Our first annual spring Sports Fest will take place in a couple weeks. Sports Fest involves the sporting aspect of powderpuff in a series of even more games, including flag football, throughout the week.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Nagar, ASB looks to continue these spring events in future years.\r\n\r\n\"Hogwarts Week and Sports Fest are both things we hope to continue as Paly traditions,\" Nagar said.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"Palo Alto High School's first Hogwarts Week ended with a junior victory today when the juniors clinched the lead from the sophomores after Friday's final Quidditch match on Paly's lacrosse field.","date":"2015-05-01 18:59:07","author":"Liana Pickrell","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/11201270_1090456807637782_1339450122_o.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"8496":"ASB","12848":"competition","17499":"FIRST","42206":"gryffindor","42205":"hogwarts week","42209":"hufflepuff","42916":"new event","8953":"paly","42693":"quidditch","42208":"ravenclaw","42207":"slytherin"}},{"id":103094,"title":"Update: Softball looks to finish strong","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/05\/01\/update-softball-looks-to-finish-strong\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_103189\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"800\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/MG_3507.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-103189\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/MG_3507.jpg\" alt=\"Softball convenes in between innings against Santa Clara on 3\/20\/15.\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" \/><\/a> The Paly softball team converses during a 6-1 loss to Santa Clara High School on March 20.
