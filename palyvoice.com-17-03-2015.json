In modern times, cars can be a source of frustration, pleasure, and sometimes even fear. However, the feelings that people have towards cars could be completely changed quite soon \u2014 maybe sooner than most expect. Local tech giant\u00a0Google, among other innovators, is working on an\u00a0ambitious endeavor to transform the future of transportation: cars that can drive themselves.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_101094\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"313\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/self-driving-car-1.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-101094\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/self-driving-car-1.jpg\" alt=\"Google employees prepare for a test drive in the parking lot of the Google headquarters in Mountain View.

Photo by Jeanette Wong.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAs part of the recent Career Month Speakers Series, Google Vehicle Development Lead Jaime Waydo came to Palo Alto High School to give a presentation and show off her team's project \u2014 a self-driving car.\r\n\r\nWaydo shared information on how the Self-Driving Car Project is developing and the future implications of these driverless cars.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe leading cause of death from people [of ages from] three to 30 in the United States is motor vehicle fatalities,\u201d Waydo said. \u201cNinety-two percent of those fatalities are from human error, meaning that the driver of the car has done something wrong. That\u2019s just tragic. So, if you take the human out of the car, you can create a driver that\u2019s never tired, a driver that never gets angry, a driver that\u2019s just always making good decisions, and make that number go away. That\u2019s really the goal of what we\u2019re working on.\u201d\r\n\r\nGoogle has been working on developing autonomous cars since 2009, according to Waydo. Since then, this project has expanded to a much larger scale.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_101096\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"264\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/self-driving-car-2.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-101096\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/self-driving-car-2.jpg\" alt=\"Sensors on either side of the car can recognize people, cars, signs and traffic lights, according to Vehicle Development Lead Jaime Waydo.

Photo by Jeanette Wong.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re [Google is] learning a lot about self-driving technology \u2014 not just on the freeway, which you saw us doing early on [as early as Jan. 2010, as evidenced by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=VAiH1LX8guk\" target=\"_blank\">this video]<\/a>, but also in more city street environments,\u201d Waydo said. \u201cThat\u2019s what why you see the Lexus driving around Mountain View a lot. We\u2019re letting the cars drive autonomously \u2014 with our safety drivers in them \u2014 and figuring out all the new challenges that can happen when you\u2019re driving in an urban environment like that.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Waydo, the different environments pose different challenges for the design team. On the freeway, although the cars are moving at high speeds and the autonomous car needs to be able to respond quickly, all the cars are moving at more or less the same speed and direction. However, on city streets, there is a lot more randomness involved and other factors that need to be considered. Pedestrians, cyclists, animals all contribute to the variables cars encounter in a city.\r\n\r\nGoogle is not alone in this undertaking. As technology continues to advance, more and more companies are looking to develop innovative ways to aid drivers on the road. Several major car manufacturers such as Audi, Toyota and Ford are in the stages of developing autonomous cars of their own, and Mercedes-Benz\u2019s most recent model features \u201cSteering Assist,\u201d in which sensors on the car can help \u201cmaintain the desired distance from another vehicle in front,\u201d according to <a href=\"http:\/\/techcenter.mercedes-benz.com\/en\/distronic_plus_steering_assist\/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">its website<\/a>.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_101097\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"259\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/self-driving-car-3.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-101097\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/self-driving-car-3.jpg\" alt=\"A sensor on the roof of the car spins in place, constantly scanning the surroundings.

Photo by Jeanette Wong.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re all trying to do the same thing: make the roads a safer place,\u201d Waydo said. \u201cThe secondary goal is to make transportation more efficient, and hopefully, with all of us working on that, there\u2019s a great environment to help foster creativity and make those challenges more solvable.\u201d\r\n\r\nAutonomous cars could revolutionize the world as we know it and greatly diminish fatal accidents and road rage, according to Waydo.\r\n\r\n\u201cAs you drive home, look at the drivers around you and look what they\u2019re doing in those cars,\u201d Waydo said. \u201cThey\u2019re talking on the phone, they\u2019re texting, they\u2019re putting on makeup, they\u2019re reading a book, they\u2019re playing a trumpet \u2014 I\u2019ve actually seen someone do that once. Those drivers are distracted and we\u2019re making a system where the driver is never distracted. The driver is never tired. The driver is never drunk. And if we can do that successfully, then I think that\u2019s a huge win for everybody.\u201d\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"overflow-y: hidden;\" src=\"https:\/\/magic.piktochart.com\/embed\/4988406-car-quotes\" width=\"600\" height=\"470\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe>\r\n<em>The Paly Voice asked members of the Paly community to share their opinions on\u00a0self-driving cars.

It is still unclear how traffic laws will change to adapt to this new technology, Waydo says.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new frontier of sorts and typically, when you see new frontiers, you see the world adapting and learning what that means to society,\" Waydo said. \"I think that\u2019s a place that we\u2019re just now starting to embark on.\u201d\r\n\r\nWaydo encourages people to ignore cost and other details for now, and instead focus on the significant problems that self-driving cars could potentially solve.\r\n\r\n\u201cEverything we do is making the world better and safer, and that\u2019s what it\u2019s about,\u201d Waydo said.","excerpt":"Local tech giant Google, among other innovators, is working on an ambitious endeavor to transform the future of transportation: cars that can drive themselves.

There have been too many young lives lost in just this past school year, and it's time for something different.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to addressing\u00a0student welfare, Diorio also noted that the administration is making\u00a0a great effort to reach out and provide support to teachers. Eight substitute teachers were available on Monday and Tuesday to step into class to allow teachers to take a break. A school\u00a0psychologist assisted the classes in which the deceased student was enrolled, according to Diorio.\r\n\r\n\"We've been keeping our pulse on how the teachers are doing and coping, and making sure they have the support and counseling that they might need,\" Diorio said.\r\n\r\nSeveral Paly parents were also invited to campus this week to engage in conversation with students and remind them of the counseling resources available.\r\n\r\n\"We have parents on campus ...\u00a0helping suggest that students go\u00a0talk to adults up in the guidance area or counselors if they need that support,\" Diorio said.\r\n\r\nDiorio hopes to further engage parents in the conversation and plans to host parent events in the future. Among these events include an open house Coffee with Paly administrators earlier this\u00a0morning, hosted by the Parent Teacher Student Association, where parents were encouraged to come talk in an informal environment.\r\n\r\n\"We know that they [parents] are concerned,\u00a0want to help out and want to talk,\" Diorio said.\r\n\r\nDiorio reiterated the main message\u00a0that the community is here to support\u00a0everyone.\r\n\r\n\"If you need support or help, please talk with any of your teachers, your teacher adviser or any staff member you see wandering about,\" Diorio wrote. \"We're here for you.\"\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>A list of school and community resources are available on the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/paly.net\/crisis-resources\" target=\"_blank\">Paly website Crisis Resources page<\/a>\u00a0and the <a href=\"http:\/\/pausd.org\/parents\/services\/counseling\/\" target=\"_blank\">PAUSD\u00a0Counseling Services page<\/a>.

Oakland will move on and host No. 5 seed Pittsburg at 6 p.m. this Saturday, March 14.\r\n\r\nWhile\u00a0the early exit is frustrating, sophomore forward Skylar Burris says\u00a0that the team will come back next year motivated and stronger compared to this year.\r\n\r\n\"Although we didn't go for as long as wanted to in CIF, it's hard to be disappointed with all the accomplishments we acheived,\" Burris said. \"Our team is so close and there really is no offseason [for us]; we're always together and always working to improve our basketball skills.\"\r\n\r\nWith no seniors on the team this year, the Vikings are expected to return next year with all\u00a0of their current players.

Participants will experience life in a rural community in a Latin American country over a three-week period in the summer and will engage\u00a0in a variety of community service activities.\r\n\r\n\"Students will travel to a small city in Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic or Ecuador and will stay in a hostel for two to three weeks,\" Foug said. \"They'll teach English to the locals in the evenings for free and work on a community action project.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the goals of the program is to\u00a0expose students to the realities of life in other parts of the world.\r\n\r\n\"They'll spend a day with the [local] families and see what it's like to live on a dollar a day,\" Foug said.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_100776\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"397\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/11051015_803181706441324_1325225690_n.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-100776\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/11051015_803181706441324_1325225690_n.jpg\" alt=\"From left: Juniors Rebecca Sunner\u00e5s Jonsson, Claire Krugler and Eli Craveiro Frankel, all participants in the Global Glimpse program, set up a bake sale in downtown Palo Alto.
