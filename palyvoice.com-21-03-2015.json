SciOly\u00a0competitions are similar to golf in that teams try\u00a0to get as low a score as possible. Winning all 23 events would give a team 23 points in total, which is the lowest possible score.\r\n\r\n\u201cOur success this year is primarily due to an accumulation of experience in engineering events, where we've stumbled in the past,\u201d Lu said. \u201cIn addition, this is the first year that we've had such a high number of upperclassmen on the team. ... Their\u00a0experience and dedication is definitely something that has impacted the performance of the team.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Lu, Paly had ten first-place finishes and averaged between second and third for the other events.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis year was our best overall performance but not really our biggest landslide victory,\u201d Lu said.\r\n\r\nLast year, the <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/03\/27\/science-olympiad-wins-regional-competition-heads-to-states\/\" target=\"_blank\">team won Regionals<\/a> but <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/04\/17\/science-olympiad-places-second-at-state-competition\/\" target=\"_blank\">came in second<\/a> at States to rival Mira Loma High School. According to junior Sylvia Targ, Paly has lost to Mira Loma at States every year for the past ten years except in 2013, when Paly advanced to Nationals and came in <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2013\/05\/21\/paly-scioly-team-makes-impressive-debut-at-nationals\/\" target=\"_blank\">16th\u00a0place<\/a> overall.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis year, we are really gunning for Nationals, and we think that we have a good shot,\" Targ said.\u00a0\"We\u2019re all super excited and so incredibly motivated.\u00a0We always have each other\u2019s backs because we know how stressful this is.

In modern times, cars can be a source of frustration, pleasure, and sometimes even fear. However, the feelings that people have towards cars could be completely changed quite soon \u2014 maybe sooner than most expect. Local tech giant\u00a0Google, among other innovators, is working on an\u00a0ambitious endeavor to transform the future of transportation: cars that can drive themselves.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_101094\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"313\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/self-driving-car-1.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-101094\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/self-driving-car-1.jpg\" alt=\"Google employees prepare for a test drive in the parking lot of the Google headquarters in Mountain View.

Photo by Jeanette Wong.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAs part of the recent Career Month Speakers Series, Google Vehicle Development Lead Jaime Waydo came to Palo Alto High School to give a presentation and show off her team's project \u2014 a self-driving car.\r\n\r\nWaydo shared information on how the Self-Driving Car Project is developing and the future implications of these driverless cars.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe leading cause of death from people [of ages from] three to 30 in the United States is motor vehicle fatalities,\u201d Waydo said. \u201cNinety-two percent of those fatalities are from human error, meaning that the driver of the car has done something wrong. That\u2019s just tragic. So, if you take the human out of the car, you can create a driver that\u2019s never tired, a driver that never gets angry, a driver that\u2019s just always making good decisions, and make that number go away. That\u2019s really the goal of what we\u2019re working on.\u201d\r\n\r\nGoogle has been working on developing autonomous cars since 2009, according to Waydo. Since then, this project has expanded to a much larger scale.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_101096\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"264\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/self-driving-car-2.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-101096\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/self-driving-car-2.jpg\" alt=\"Sensors on either side of the car can recognize people, cars, signs and traffic lights, according to Vehicle Development Lead Jaime Waydo.

Photo by Jeanette Wong.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re [Google is] learning a lot about self-driving technology \u2014 not just on the freeway, which you saw us doing early on [as early as Jan. 2010, as evidenced by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=VAiH1LX8guk\" target=\"_blank\">this video]<\/a>, but also in more city street environments,\u201d Waydo said. \u201cThat\u2019s what why you see the Lexus driving around Mountain View a lot. We\u2019re letting the cars drive autonomously \u2014 with our safety drivers in them \u2014 and figuring out all the new challenges that can happen when you\u2019re driving in an urban environment like that.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Waydo, the different environments pose different challenges for the design team. On the freeway, although the cars are moving at high speeds and the autonomous car needs to be able to respond quickly, all the cars are moving at more or less the same speed and direction. However, on city streets, there is a lot more randomness involved and other factors that need to be considered. Pedestrians, cyclists, animals all contribute to the variables cars encounter in a city.\r\n\r\nGoogle is not alone in this undertaking. As technology continues to advance, more and more companies are looking to develop innovative ways to aid drivers on the road. Several major car manufacturers such as Audi, Toyota and Ford are in the stages of developing autonomous cars of their own, and Mercedes-Benz\u2019s most recent model features \u201cSteering Assist,\u201d in which sensors on the car can help \u201cmaintain the desired distance from another vehicle in front,\u201d according to <a href=\"http:\/\/techcenter.mercedes-benz.com\/en\/distronic_plus_steering_assist\/detail.html\" target=\"_blank\">its website<\/a>.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_101097\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"259\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/self-driving-car-3.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-101097\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/self-driving-car-3.jpg\" alt=\"A sensor on the roof of the car spins in place, constantly scanning the surroundings.

It is still unclear how traffic laws will change to adapt to this new technology, Waydo says.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new frontier of sorts and typically, when you see new frontiers, you see the world adapting and learning what that means to society,\" Waydo said. \"I think that\u2019s a place that we\u2019re just now starting to embark on.\u201d\r\n\r\nWaydo encourages people to ignore cost and other details for now, and instead focus on the significant problems that self-driving cars could potentially solve.\r\n\r\n\u201cEverything we do is making the world better and safer, and that\u2019s what it\u2019s about,\u201d Waydo said.","excerpt":"Local tech giant Google, among other innovators, is working on an ambitious endeavor to transform the future of transportation: cars that can drive themselves.

Although\u00a0most students don\u2019t plan on cutting class, they predict that there will be a fair amount of students that will.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m not [going to cut], but I know a lot of people that are going to skip,\u201d junior Shivani Parikh said. \u201cThey don\u2019t see the point of having three days off and then two more days off.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn agreement of the awkward scheduling, senior Yerem Istanboulian offers a possible solution for next year.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf they could just move the day off on Friday to Monday, that would be better,\u201d Istanboulian said.\r\n\r\n<strong>Teachers<\/strong>\r\n\r\nCAHSEE testing has always been mandated by the state as the Tuesday and Wednesday of the third week in March.\r\n\r\nSophomore English teacher Trinity Klein believes that many teachers have gotten used to CAHSEE testing and just see the upcoming schedule as a long weekend followed by a light week of work.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that the long weekend doesn't really make a difference because we have a regular schedule on Monday,\u201d Klein said. \u201cIt [the CAHSEE] is not a labor-intensive process. They [the rest of the weekdays] are just light work days compared to normal.\u201d\r\n\r\n<strong>Administration<\/strong>\r\n\r\nRecognizing that absence rates will naturally be a little higher than usual on Monday, Assistant Principal Jerry Berkson said that missing one day of school is not a big deal. Berkson also agreed that having the district move the local holiday to Monday rather than Friday would have worked out better in hindsight.\r\n\r\n\"It's not the end of the world, kids missing one day,\" Berkson said. \"I think a student could survive missing one day, not that I'm encouraging them to just take it off.\"","excerpt":"The majority of Palo Alto High School students will seemingly have an unofficial early spring break due to the combination of a local holiday, the weekend and the California High School Exit Examination, or CAHSEE, testing next week.
