The lunchtime rally, in addition to including cheers and a\u00a0best-dressed competition, featured a tug-of-war contest. In the first round, the seniors quickly\u00a0defeated\u00a0the freshmen, and the sophomores pulled an upset victory over the juniors. In the championship game, the seniors prevailed over\u00a0the sophomores to take first place. In the consolation game, the juniors edged out the freshmen.\r\n\r\nJunior Jasmine Abeyta, who participated in the activity, said that the juniors were disadvantaged because their participants were relatively smaller than those from the sophomore class.\r\n\r\n\"We're the only grade that doesn't have any really large\u00a0people,\" Abeyta said. \"So that was one factor that contributed to our downfall.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to\u00a0their second place finish in tug-of-war, the sophomores also had a strong showing during the rally today.\r\n\r\n\"My grade level [sophomores] had a lot more spirit than last year,\" said sophomore Nicholas Zhao. \"This was very strange compared to last year, because we came in last.\"\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior Reid Walters, one of the Associated Student Body's spirit commissioners, was pleased with the results of the lunch rally.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\"Logistically, it [tug-of-war] was really easy to set up and it's a tradition here, so it was fun,\" she said. \"Of course, I am happy that the seniors did well, but I am also happy that the entire school was really excited. The second day, the freshmen also started getting it together which was exciting, so we\u2019ll see how the scores end up today.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"600\" height=\"430\" src=\"\/\/www.cincopa.com\/media-platform\/iframe.aspx?fid=AUHAcB9JF0Jq\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe>","excerpt":"After a strong performance during the lunch rally and a victory in tug-of-war today, the senior class is poised to jump in the Palo Alto High School Spirit Week standings.","date":"2015-10-20 19:17:24","author":"Dhara Yu","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/I9P3236.jpg","categories":["Spirit Week 2015","Spotlight"],"tags":["ASB","jasmine abeyta","nicholas zhao","paly spirit week","reid walters","salad dressing day","Spirit Week","spirit week 2015"]},{"id":110277,"title":"Video: Spirit Week 2015 continues with Salad Dressing Day","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/10\/20\/video-spirit-week-2015-continues-with-salad-dressing-day\/","content":"<iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/a0PTN8n_R_Y\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\nThe Paly Voice documented Day Two of Palo Alto High School Spirit Week 2015.

Photo by Aisha Chabane.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Paly Voice sat down with singer, songwriter and musician junior Georgina Wu to discuss her musical journey and to compile a list of her favorite songs.\r\n\r\nWu is an active member of the choir community and also writes and performs music whenever she gets a chance.\r\n\r\nAccording to Wu, her musical journey began when she discovered the world of Spotify.\r\n\r\n\u201cI downloaded anything that I could get, anything that I thought sounded good,\u201d Wu said. \u201cI listened to it all the time. Since then, listening to music has become a really huge part of my life. I would feel really weird if I didn\u2019t listen to music everyday.\u201d\r\n\r\nNot only is Wu a singer and songwriter, she also enjoys playing the piano and guitar.\r\n\r\nAccording to Wu, her vocal coach Ying Wang discovered her talent when she was a freshman and thanks to Wang\u2019s assistance Wu has more confidence in her singing abilities.\r\n\r\n\u201cBefore I met that teacher I thought that I was okay in singing, but when I met her she taught me techniques and made me realize how good I am,\u201d Wu said. \u201cShe brought me into music and she always had the confidence in me.\u201d\r\n\r\nWu gets ideas and techniques from a variety of artists but her biggest creative inspiration is Lady Gaga.\r\n\r\n\u201cI look up to all different artists, I take all different things, and performing styles and techniques from all different artists,\u201d Wu said. \u201cBut for inspiration I really like Lady Gaga. She just does not care.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Wu, her taste in music has changed as she got older.\r\n\r\n\u201cI used to listen to really poppy music like Britney Spears and Taylor Swift,\u201d Wu said. \u201cI really got into rocky alternative and later I listened to R&amp;B rap songs. Right now I\u2019m really into dance electronic music, but through all of this I have always had a fascination with classical music.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Wu, music has made her a more sensitive person and encourages others to try music.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think it raises your emotional sensitivity and listening or playing music will make you a more compassionate and a kind person,\" Wu said.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/embed.spotify.com\/?uri=spotify%3Auser%3Aaishachabane%3Aplaylist%3A3vwhjl1mqzmKJvtUSQudUv\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>","excerpt":"The Paly Voice sat down with singer,songwriter and talented musician junior Georgina Wu to discuss her musical journey and to compile a list of her favorite songs.","date":"2015-10-20 14:44:05","author":"Aisha Chabane","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/IMG_35751.jpg","categories":["Blog"],"tags":["alternativerock","choir","georginawu","Guitar","music","piano","spotify"]},{"id":110152,"title":"Girls&#8217; tennis hopes for a break against Los Altos","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/10\/20\/girls-tennis-hopes-for-a-break-against-los-altos\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_110160\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"360\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/IMG_2130.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-110160\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/IMG_2130.jpg\" alt=\"senior [[[\" width=\"360\" height=\"322\" \/><\/a> Senior co-captain Halle Biorn works to improve her serves during practice.

Photo by Cooper Lou.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Palo Alto High School administration is promising an investigation\u00a0after a streaker ran across the football field during a Spirit Week lunch rally today.\r\n\r\nSenior Masha Konkov, who witnessed the incident along with most of the 2,000-person student body gathered in the stands, said the streaker darted across the field\u00a0at the end of the lunch rally, just after the activities had concluded and students started to leave the stands.\r\n\r\n\"My friend sees him and she's like 'Oh my god, Masha' and I see a dude...\u00a0sprinting across the football field,\" Konkov said. \"It appeared that he had come from the shed near the track and then everyone assumed it was a senior because we started cheering ... but I think that's because we assumed it was an upperclassman and got all excited about it.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to junior Ben Cleasby, another witness, the streaker ran off the football field toward Churchill Avenue, jumped over the fence and entered a light silver car that drove away immediately.\r\n\r\nThe Associated Student Body, which is responsible for the Spirit Week festivities, has not issued\u00a0an official statement. However, keeping with the administration's recent crackdown\u00a0on streaking incidents, Dean of Students Adam Paulson promised a thorough investigation.\r\n\r\n\"All I can say is that we're very disappointed and we take this very seriously, so we're definitely going to look into it,\" he said.\r\n\r\nPrincipal Kim Diorio released an official statement through email shortly after the incident occurred.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Paly administration is taking today's streaking incident very seriously and has launched an investigation. Any students involved in the illegal activity of streaking will be subject to disciplinary action as outlined on page 35 of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.paly.net\/student-handbook\">Student Handbook<\/a>.\r\n\r\n\"We\u2019re disappointed this happened and hope this isolated incident does not ruin Spirit Week\u00a0for the majority of our school. We're not planning on sending communication home for a variety of reasons. Instead, we want to take the focus our attention on the hard work and planning that has gone into making this a great Spirit Week. Shout out to our ASB students and [Student Activities Director] Mr. [Matt] Hall!\r\n\r\n\"To that end, we hope students and staff will continue to come out and cheer on our fabulous Vikings during the rallies that lie ahead. \u00a0We believe this show of support makes a statement to all of our students that this incident is not reflective of what we value at our school.\u201d\r\n\r\nOver the past few years, administrators have\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2013\/08\/15\/principal-releases-letter-regarding-streaking-incident\/\">made it a priority to eliminate streaking<\/a>.
