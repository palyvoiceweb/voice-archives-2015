Photo by Malcolm Slaney.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAgainst Lynbrook, the varsity boys (4-2) fell short in the 4x400 meter relay, the final, and arguably most exciting event of the meet.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings started out strong with the boys varsity team winning the 4x100 meter relay and sophomore Kent Slaney winning the 1600-meter race, but things started to take a turn for the worse when Lynbrook swept both the 110-meter high hurdles and the 300-meter low hurdle races.\r\n\r\nAccording to former boys sprinter Tak Nishi, who was added to the hurdles team just two weeks before the end of the season to try to get some points in the hurdle events, the team will only get better with time and practice.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have a really good coach who is new this year and even though I haven't been in hurdles for very long from what I've seen, we just don't have the numbers of boys that would allow us to perform well,\u201d Nishi said. \u201cIn addition, we have only one varsity hurdler who has been there the entire season so our hurdles team is really very young.\u201d\r\n\r\nPlacing in the hurdle events will be crucial for next year's team success, which will compliment the strong frontline of athletes that have been dominating the varsity scene in sprints and distance races including juniors Dami Bolarinwa, Eli Givens, and sophomore Kent Slaney.\r\n\r\nIn Thursday\u2019s meet against Lynbrook, Slaney showed his impressive abilities in his win in the 1600-meter race, when he opened a three-second gap in the last 150 meters of the race. Slaney finished with a 4:37.48 time.\r\n\r\nYoung talent such as sophomore Thorin Haussecker, who earned a personal record in the 200- meter race and is ranked 13th in the De Anza League, is looking forward to the opportunity of running varsity next season.\r\n\r\n\u201cI'm looking forward to racing varsity next year especially in the 4x100 meter race with some of the other great sprinters and I'm going to do a lot of training in the off season to make sure I'm in shape once next year\u2019s season begins,\u201d Haussecker said.\r\n\r\nDespite the regular season being over and the loss to Lynbrook, the Vikings have their heads held high and many are looking forward to De Anza League trials at 3:15 p.m. next Tuesday, May 5 at Lynbrook High School. The Vikings, along with the other schools in DAL will send their three best athletes for each event to the meet for a chance to earn a qualifying spot in the De Anza League finals, which will occur on Thursday, May 7, again at Lynbrook.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School boys\u2019 track and field team is looking forward to the De Anza League meets next week after a close loss against Lynbrook High School on Thursday.

But accompanying the district\u2019s apparent success is a stream of criticism from disgruntled parents, students and educators, as well as national media.\r\n\r\nNothing has ignited more vehement condemnation of the schools than the three student deaths by suicide this school year. Everything becomes more urgent, and the weaknesses of the district appear even more magnified in the wake of such tragedies.\r\n\r\nPeople found all kinds of outlets to express their opinions on the schools\u2019 failure to mitigate student stress, including local newspapers, school board meetings, forums and social media. In an article on Palo Alto Online, guest writer and Palo Alto High School junior Carolyn Walworth, the school's appointed student representative to the district Board of Education, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.paloaltoonline.com\/news\/2015\/03\/25\/guest-opinion-the-sorrows-of-young-palo-altans\">describes her personal experiences and opinion about the community\u2019s actions surrounding the issue<\/a>. Palo Alto\u2019s suicide problem was even addressed in The New York Times \u2014 not once, but twice. Frank Bruni writes about the apparent deterioration of mental health in high-performing communities, using Palo Alto as the case study, in his Op-ed, \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/04\/12\/opinion\/sunday\/frank-bruni-best-brightest-and-saddest.html?_r=0\">Best, Brightest \u2014 and Saddest?<\/a>\u201d while Matt Richtel tackles the issue of academic pressure at Paly and Gunn High School in his feature, \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/04\/26\/sunday-review\/push-dont-crush-the-students.html?fb_ref=Default&amp;_r=1\">Push, Don\u2019t Crush, the Students<\/a>.\u201d Bruni and Richter quote Walworth as the sole youth voice in both their articles, therefore implying that her perspective is somehow representative of the entire student body.\r\n\r\nAll three seem to have arrived at the same conclusion: Students simply can\u2019t escape the ultra-competitive atmosphere of Palo Alto, and many get sucked in so deep that they come to believe their entire livelihood is dependent on which college they gain admission to.\r\n\r\nWalworth, Bruni and Richtel bring up fair points \u2014 no one can deny that competition and stress are pervasive in Palo Alto schools. \u00a0We know that there are students who have to deal with unhealthy amounts of pressure and may feel obliged to meet unattainably high expectations.\r\n\r\nBut this is not everyone. The perceived image of the typical Palo Alto student as completely focused on academic success and nothing else, perpetuated by these writers, is overgeneralized. And these absurdly broad accusations indicate a fundamental lack of understanding about the problem.\r\n\r\nIn their attempt to analyze the problem at hand, some observers end up ascribing characteristics of a select few to the entire population of Palo Alto. Not every student takes too many rigorous classes or has a plethora of extracurricular activities, and of those who do, the chief intention is not always to get into a prestigious university. Many of us embark on these endeavours because of a genuine desire to learn, to invent, to improve ourselves and our communities. And with so many opportunities to engage in these interests around us, in part because our schools are so very good at providing them, why not take them on? It\u2019s not a crime to show passion in wide-ranging disciplines like the visual arts, science, athletics, music, politics, writing and theater, just to name a few. Regardless of what some may try to convey, we are passionate about and proud of our pursuits.\r\n\r\nWe would like to dispel the idea that students being stressed means that students are always focused on academic success. Just because people admit to having some anxiety in their lives does not mean they are soulless automatons in rabid pursuit of an Ivy League degree.\r\n\r\nIn addition to implying that Palo Altans are overly success-focused, Richtel in particular insinuates that all of the suicides were caused solely by academic pressure. But each one was caused by a different set of circumstances, and each one should be treated as an individual tragedy. For us to achieve our goal of making schools a healthy and enriching environment for everyone, we need community members and outside observers alike to avoid stereotyping or making blanket statements.\r\n\r\nWe believe that people who blame certain groups for the current problems that exist within our school district \u2014 administration for making classes too difficult, parents for pressuring their children to succeed, students for their excessive competitiveness, etc. \u2014 are counterproductive. We appreciate that people have stepped forward to share their perspectives on mental health, and it\u2019s nice to know that our community has a vested interest in this problem, but anyone who faults any particular group for this vastly convoluted issue is being unfair and certainly not helpful.\r\n\r\nThe serious problems within the education system should be recognized, but we also need to maintain a positive outlook to avoid a sense of hopelessness that is not conducive to productivity. We realize that the negative comments stem from frustration and sadness about student deaths, but we still want to encourage those who have made abrasive remarks to offer support and constructive criticism rather than tear others down.\r\n\r\nIn all our dialogue about the issue of student pressure, we often forget that educators in the community have very much responded to the community\u2019s cries for change \u2014 <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/02\/01\/editorial-an-appreciation-of-teacher-support-at-paly\/\">easing homework loads<\/a> and\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/11\/04\/administration-offers-student-support-in-wake-of-gunn-student-death\/\">improving counseling services<\/a>\u00a0are two of many changes being instated in the schools. We applaud the school board, educators, students and parents for coming together and enacting these measures. We know how difficult it is to make broad, sweeping reforms that are effective for the general populace.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s no panacea, no one ordinance, that will make all feelings of anxiety and despair disappear completely. But with constructive feedback from students, parents and educators, and a city-wide willingness to listen, we will take steps toward making the school environment more inviting and accommodating for everyone.\r\n\r\nWe Palo Altans are defined by more than just our flaws. We are lively, diverse, compassionate and innovative, and deserve to be viewed as such.\r\n\r\n<i>Editor's note: The author of \"Push, Don't Crush, the Students\" is\u00a0<span style=\"line-height: normal; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);\">Matt Richtel, not Matt Richter as previously stated.<\/span><\/i>","excerpt":"In the wake of tragedies in Palo Alto, our community and the national media have found various outlets to express their opinions on the schools\u2019 failure to mitigate student stress.

Each subcommittee was assigned to come up with solutions through looking at one of the following targeted focuses: best practices, data analysis, community and district resources, procuring panels and process design.\r\n\r\nA writing team comprised of members from the MATD committee is tasked with consolidating the recommendations and preparing a draft, according to district Communications Coordinator Tabitha Kappeler-Hurley. In addition to identifying the finalized solutions, the team will be gathering data on cost and implementation of each solution.\r\n\r\nAccording to a timeline by Palo Alto Unified School District Supt. Max McGee, the draft will continue to be revised until May 21 when the final report and solutions will be sent to the Board of Education. McGee said Tuesday that a select group of members from the full committee will present to the board on May 26.\u00a0Kappeler-Hurley said that the finalized recommendations should be posted online by May 22, at latest.\r\n\r\nDuring Tuesday\u2019s meeting, Kappeler-Hurley proposed several possible communication methods to get feedback on the drafted solutions from the community after the board presentation. Ideas included customizing types of outreach to target specific audiences; translating the report into five common secondary languages; sending out notifications through student, parent and staff portals like Schoology and Infinite Campus; and having district-hired summer interns create a video of the finalized recommendations. None of the ideas have been implemented as of yet, but Kappeler-Hurley said the committee will be trying to maximize outreach to the best of its ability.\r\n\r\n\u201cAlthough I don\u2019t have an exact timeline or set of specific strategies yet, \u00a0I will be working with the writing committee and Dr. McGee to reach all audiences in effective way,\u201d Kappeler-Hurley wrote in an email to The Paly Voice.\r\n\r\nAccording to a letter sent out by McGee in December, the committee was assembled to \u201cprepare a set of strategic, evidence-based recommendations that, when implemented, will enable the PAUSD community to assure underrepresented minority students and other students from disadvantaged circumstances have the necessary opportunities, conditions and supports that will empower and enable them to succeed as well as both realize and maximize their full intellectual, creative and social potential.\"\r\n\r\nAs the final meeting of the committee Tuesday night drew to a close, members expressed differing sentiments about the success of the MATD task force.\r\n\r\n\"We're ground breakers in closing the achievement gap and I think it's important that we appreciate that,\" committee member and Gunn High School sophomore Shannon Yang said.\r\n\r\nCommittee member and instructional aide Arcia Dorosti said, \"I'm cautious to celebrate anything because I don't think we've accomplished anything just yet until the outcomes change. We still have to see it through.\u201d","excerpt":"A district-wide committee targeting the achievement gap for students of disadvantaged backgrounds in the Palo Alto Unified School District is refining proposed solutions before presenting to the Board of Education on May 26 and is preparing to seek community input on the finalized draft.","date":"2015-04-30 16:22:49","author":"Charles Yu","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/IMG_20150428_194421.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":{"38291":"achievement gap","11799":"Board of Education","42689":"matd","42687":"max","42691":"May 26","25038":"McGee","42688":"minority achievement and talent development","8977":"PAUSD","42690":"tabitha kappeler-hurley"}},{"id":103023,"title":"Speaker on Japanese internment tonight","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/04\/30\/speaker-on-japanese-internment-tonight\/","content":"Satsuki Ina, the founder of The Children of the Camps Project, will speak about her experience as\u00a0a Japanese-American during the end of World War II tonight at Palo Alto High School.

According to Paly choir teacher Michael Najar, the choirs will perform Bach\u2019s Cantatas and Mozart\u2019s \"Vesperae solennes de confessore.\"\r\n\r\n\u201cBach and Mozart are the two greatest composers that one would think of when they would think of classical music,\u201d Najar said. \u201cI\u2019m really excited about pitting these two great composers against each other.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Paly Choirs will not be the only ones participating in the concert, according to Najar.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing it with a hired orchestra,\u201d Najar said. \u201cSome soloists from Stanford are going to join our own soloists from Paly Choir, so it\u2019s a really remarkable concert.\u201d\r\n\r\nJunior Clare Kemmerer, a member\u00a0of Paly choir\u00a0who will be singing at the concert, says that the choirs have\u00a0been working to get ready for the concert.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that by the time we perform on Friday, we will be even better,\u201d Kemmerer said. \u201cIt has been an educational experience to sing really big classical pieces. We\u2019ve definitely been challenged by it.\u201d\r\n\r\nKemmerer also says the concert is made unique by the challenging and extremely well-known classical music, making it more difficult to sing.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe do classical pieces but not to the extent of Bach and Mozart,\u201d Kemmerer said. \"Bach and Mozart are up there in how hard they are to sing, because largely they are not just choral pieces. It\u2019s a different technique of singing. We\u2019ve never done a concert that is purely Bach and Mozart.\u201d\r\n\r\nNajar says that he looking forward to the upcoming concert.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have an outstanding choir,\u201d Najar said. \u201cWe always challenge ourselves to do great music because we have incredible students who are really well trained.\u201d\r\n\r\nTickets can be bought at the door for\u00a0$10 for adults and $5 for seniors, and admission is free for students and children.
