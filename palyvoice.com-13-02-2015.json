According to its <a href=\"http:\/\/www.comap.com\/about\/#b\" target=\"_blank\">website<\/a>, the contest's mission is to establish\u00a0learning environments where mathematical tools are used to investigate, model and explore real issues in the\u00a0world.\r\n\r\nHigh schools are given\u00a0two\u00a0problem sets, and the teams then set aside 36 hours within a\u00a0two\u00a0week period to work on them.\u00a0Competitors have freedom setting up the parameters of the problem and the\u00a0problems can therefore have\u00a0many\u00a0different correct answers.\r\n\r\nDespite the team\u2019s strong teamwork, victory did not come easily.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was very proud of our thorough research and our model,\u201d Li said. \u201cThe question itself was very open-ended, so we needed to make a lot of assumptions. Our model took the longest to make, and it was extremely satisfying to see that the numbers it produced made sense.\u201d\r\n\r\nLi looks forward to the international competition.\r\n\r\n\u201cFor the [international competition], our goals are just to try to find a novel way to use math to solve an everyday problem,\u201d Li said. \u201cWe also want to learn about different types of mathematical modeling and use them to help us solve problems.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe international contest will be at Paly in a math room yet to be determined, according to Lee, who added that competing teams will choose five consecutive days to compete between mid-April and mid-June.\r\n\r\nThe team\u00a0has chosen to compete from April 19 to 23.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe will try our best and be happy with the outcome,\u201d Zhang said. \u201cIt's already a great honor to be selected to represent the United States in the international competition.\u201d","excerpt":"Four Palo Alto High School juniors in BC Calculus will be representing the United States at the International Math Modeling contest this April after their victory in the 17th Annual National High School Mathematical Contest in Modeling last month.","date":"2015-02-11 12:37:00","author":"Daniel Li","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/math_award_students2.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":{"12848":"competition","8788":"International","8871":"math","38288":"math competition","38290":"math modeling contest","38289":"mathematics","8944":"palo alto high school","8953":"paly"}},{"id":97545,"title":"Valentine&#8217;s Day Gift Guide 2015","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/02\/11\/valentines-day-gift-guide-2015\/","content":"Valentine's Day is right around the corner, and you don't want to wait until the last minute to think of a gift for the one you love.\r\n\r\nIf you feel like flowers, chocolates and teddy bears are too mainstream and want to go for something a little more personalized, look no further!

These are the words that have been used to address how, as a society, we can hope to recover from this tragedy and prevent such an event from reoccurring.\r\n\r\nAs a community, we have struggled to find ways to offer consolation and\u00a0show support for affected loved ones and community members during this time of grieving. The teachers, administration and school board of the district all showed efforts to reach out to students and remind them of the many available resources. However, there still remains conflict among many members of the community, particularly among high school students, about how to confront an issue as sensitive as suicide. Many student Facebook users have posted statuses to communicate to their friends and peers that they are available to offer support. Others argue that the support necessary to address mental health goes far beyond anything a change in a profile picture\u00a0can offer. Some don red and black to show support for Gunn students, while others believe that such an act only serves to encourage \"copycat syndrome.\"\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_97988\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"243\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/10888512_10203570932609361_4204563316199167029_n.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-97988\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/10888512_10203570932609361_4204563316199167029_n.jpg\" alt=\"The recent death of a Gunn  senior prompted a wave of changes in profile pictures, a tactic that many students used to demonstrate support for their peers.

Photo courtesy of anonymous Facebook user.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe teens\u00a0of Palo Alto may never come to a consensus on how to show that we care about each other. The important thing, however, is to remember that we do. At the end of the day, high school, in the Silicon Valley in particular, is hard for pretty much everyone. It's hard for the jocks who labor under the stereotype of being jocks. It's hard\u00a0for the closet poets who are too ashamed to reveal their gift of written word. It's hard\u00a0for the people who are just trying to make it to graduation, when they can embrace the life that awaits outside the walls of high school.\r\n\r\nNo matter what school we go to, what grade we are in or what kind of student we are,\u00a0we all experience the ups and downs of high school. As adolescents, we all have to endure\u00a0feelings of awkwardness, unhappiness and mediocrity, whether it be in academics, after school activities, or sociability. Popular culture showed us that in order to be happy, we need to have it all \u2013 looks, brains, strength, the whole package.\r\n\r\nThe result: high school becomes a competition where we are pit against our peers, our classmates, and our friends. It doesn't matter how many parties we get invited to, because someone prettier than us or funnier than us gets invited to more. The person who\u00a0outscores us on the math test ruined the curve and screwed up our GPA, and our futures are thus ruined. The kid who plays six instruments and captains the soccer team is our\u00a0enemy, because her\u00a0accomplishments undermine everything we think we should be proud of about ourselves. In this system, we are forced to stay afloat by drowning the people we should be turning to for support.\r\n\r\nWe are all subjects of a strenuous system, and for that reason, we should serve as a support system for one another. It's time we show compassion for our classmates that we never talk to because they are too weird, or too popular, or simply too different. It's time\u00a0for us to stop resenting the people who are smarter than us, or more athletic, or more musical or more talented in every way. It's time to forge bonds with the people high school turned against us. It's time to create a sense of unity in which all students feel accepted and appreciated by their peers. It's time for us to mean it when we say \"We Are All In This Together.\"\r\n\r\nThe student who outscored you on the test is not your arch-nemesis, but instead a fellow victim of intense pressures created by a society that prides itself in producing top-ranking students. The girl who seems confident\u00a0all the time is also struggling with self-esteem issues created by the enigmatic hierarchy of high school popularity. The shy kid on the quad sits alone during lunch because nobody talks to him, and nobody talks to him because he is always alone.\r\n\r\nSometimes, the difficulties faced by high schoolers is caused by mental illness, a challenge beyond our reach, yet a\u00a0challenge\u00a0we must address. The only way to properly deal with mental health is through professional help, but as fellow peers we play a\u00a0role in offering emotional comfort and mutual support.\r\n\r\nHigh school hands each individual their own unique experience, but if we make solidarity, acceptance, and friendship the norms for our peer to peer relationships, we will ultimately have a hand in\u00a0making each experience a positive one. Students should perceive each other as allies during the phase of our lives that challenges\u00a0us all. It is our obligation to each other as fellow students to remember that the people we see as our competition are experiencing the same anxieties and stresses that we do, and the energy we spend begrudging each other would be better spent befriending each other.\r\n\r\nI have grown up in Palo Alto for nearly my whole life, and I love this beautiful city that I call my home. This is the place where people dream of coming to make a better life. This is the birthplace of innovation, and the heart of opportunity and free-thinking. We have so much to be proud of, yet so much potential to be better. I want Palo Alto to go down in history for its strengths, not the crippling consequences of the actions that we take to become strong.\r\n\r\nThis is a direct message to my fellow Palo Alto teenagers: I am optimistic\u00a0that each of us has the power to help make high school a happier place for everybody. I believe that if we change our attitudes about our classmates, we can serve as one another's greatest resource in helping to make it through the awkward, challenging and demanding stage that is high school. In order for such a change to occur, we must create a camaraderie among ourselves and remember that the people we encounter on a daily basis are our equals, not our enemies. With the choices we make about how we treat our peers, we can all help make high school a little less hard.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"Staff writer Hannah Nguyen addresses how, as students, we can help make high school a more positive experience.","date":"2015-02-10 17:26:04","author":"Hannah Nguyen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/10888512_10203570932609361_4204563316199167029_n.jpg","categories":["Editor's Pick","Opinion"],"tags":{"8611":"Community","37655":"mental health","9135":"suicide","37654":"support","31762":"unity"}},{"id":98500,"title":"Choir to perform soul-themed Pops Concert","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/02\/09\/choir-to-perform-soul-themed-pops-concert\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_98504\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/14138647541_ddd91b8a4a_z1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-98504\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/14138647541_ddd91b8a4a_z1.jpg\" alt=\"Paly Choirs bows at the Pops Concert 2014.

But despite the club\u2019s success as well as its prominent social media presence, quite a few Paly students are unaware of what the club is actually about. Paly DECA co-presidents junior Stephanie Cong and junior Karina Chan help explain the organization\u2019s objectives.\r\n\r\n\u201cDECA is just a club that enhances learning of any business-related topics through competitive conferences,\u201d Cong said.\r\n\r\nDECA, which formerly stood for Distributive Education Clubs of America but is no longer used as an acronym for anything, is a club intended to increase high school students' knowledge of the professional world. Chapters participate in contests at the regional, state and international levels in which students compete in various business-related events. Most of the\u00a0events involve students showcasing their knowledge of a specific field of business, usually by making\u00a0a sales pitch to a series of judges.\r\n\r\n\u201cEach person has a different event,\"\u00a0Chan said.\u00a0\"There are over 50 events offered, so there\u2019s a lot of detail that goes into it, which is why it\u2019s so hard to explain to people.\"\r\n\r\nSo far, Paly DECA has attended the Leadership and Competitive Excellence Conference, an introductory event that offers workshops for DECA members to learn about the events offered and to improve their skills, and the Silicon Valley district conference.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe were pretty successful [in the Silicon Valley conference],\" Chan said\u00a0\"A third of all members who attended placed in their contests.\"\r\n\r\nLast year\u2019s DECA was practically nonexistent, and Chan said\u00a0she was inspired to revitalize the club at Paly after seeing the success of DECA programs at\u00a0other local high schools.\r\n\r\n\u201cOther schools [Gunn, Lynbrook, Monta Vista\u00a0and\u00a0Mission San Jose] have big DECA clubs \u2013 all 200 to 400 people \u2013 and definitely there\u2019s no club like that at Paly,\u201d Chan said.\u00a0\u201cI wanted to start DECA to help give people that kind of experience.\u201d\r\n\r\nBoth presidents attribute DECA\u2019s popularity at Paly to the idea that the club gives people the opportunity to learn valuable skills and gain real-world business experience.\r\n\r\n\u201cA lot of people can see themselves going into the field [hospitality, finance, entrepreneurship, management, marketing] that they are currently studying for DECA,\u201d Cong said. \u201cAs well as that, it [DECA] gives people an opportunity to network with other high school students.\u201d\r\n\r\nTo promote their club, members have taken to social media; on two separate occasions, members have changed their profile pictures on Facebook to DECA-themed images. Cong and Chan both say\u00a0DECA\u2019s social media approach is an effective way to advertise the club and attract potential members.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe know that if people don\u2019t even know what DECA is when we talk to them, we have to have the same conversation over and over,\"\u00a0Cong said.\u00a0\"Having a large social media presence gets our name out there initially.\u201d\r\n\r\nChan asserts that having a dynamic social media presence isn\u2019t the main focus of Paly DECA.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe value of our club is not our social media presence \u2013 it\u2019s what skills we can offer to students,\u201d Chan said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the profile pictures.\"","excerpt":"This year, a new club has risen to prominence at Palo Alto High School: DECA.

In this first installment of a three-part series, The Paly Voice features the youngest and least-experienced members of the Palo Alto High School varsity basketball teams: the freshmen.<\/em>\r\n\r\nThis year, the girls' team features two freshmen, while the boys' team has just one \u2013 the first freshman to make the boys' varsity team since alumnus E.J Floreal, who currently <a title=\"EJ Floreal UK Profile\" href=\"http:\/\/www.ukathletics.com\/sports\/m-baskbl\/mtt\/ej_floreal_862043.html\" target=\"_blank\">plays for the University of Kentucky<\/a>, during the 2009-10 season.

Tell us what that means to you.\r\n\r\nMax Dorward: It's a huge accomplishment for me. I've been playing basketball my entire life, and I worked really hard to get to this point. I'm thankful that I made it onto varsity, but I still would have been very proud of myself if I had made it onto JV. Varsity is a huge, huge accomplishment.\r\n\r\nTPV: There are a lot of experienced players on the varsity team: Kevin [Mullin] and Johnny [Rojahn] in particular, Alex [Dees] as well. Who do you look up to most playing-wise and leadership-wise?\r\n\r\nMD: I think all of our seniors are really good. They're undoubtedly the leaders on our team. Kevin has his traits of leadership while Johnny has the other traits and Alex has some of his traits as well. A combination of all three is really great. Juniors are also a big part \u2013 Oliver [Svirsky], Justin [Hull], Mikey [Grandy], they all possess aspects of leadership. Rather than look at individuals, I really like to look at our entire team and really take a little bit of something from everyone.\r\n\r\nTPV: What is your take on Coach Sax developing you into not just a basketball player at Paly, but also as a student in high school? What has he done to help you transition from the middle school to the high school level?\r\n\r\nMD: Knowing that we are all just in high school, he relates to me and everyone else by bringing in these quotes that really help us just play our games. In practice he also brings in quotes from Macbeth and other novels that he really likes. He can really relate to us well that way.\r\n\r\nTPV: In terms of your current role on the team, you realize that being a freshman means you probably won't get as many opportunities as you will as later as an upperclassmen. This year, though, what do you want your role to be the rest of the season? You're playing a healthy amount for a freshman.\r\n\r\nMD: I was coming into this year expecting to not play at all, similar to how Kevin didn't really play his sophomore year. That year was more of a developing year for the coming seasons. That's what I was expecting. I was really taken back when I began getting a lot of playing time as a freshman. This year, I'm still taking it as a stride for future years to really develop myself and get better as a player.\r\n\r\nTPV: Think about the professional level, just for a moment. Out of all of the NBA players that you could choose from, which one do you look up to most? Not just playing-wise, but also think about who you want to become as a person.\r\n\r\nMD: There's a lot of great players to choose from. People may right away think about Kobe [Bryant], LeBron [James], Kevin Durant. For me, Stephen Curry is my guy. I really like him a lot because he's a leader as well as a great player. He also kind of started out with nobody knowing who he was, and he's worked really hard to get to where he is. I look up to him more than the other great players.\r\n\r\nTPV: You started playing basketball at an early age. Your brother [Lukas Dorward] currently plays over at Gunn. How early did playing varsity basketball become a real possibility in your mind?\u00a0When did that hit you?\r\n\r\nMD: Over this past summer, I played for Coach Sax over summer league. I thought I had a small shot making varsity then. I later found out that I was being asked to try out, and really try and be on the team. That's when it really hit me that I had a really good shot at making varsity.\r\n\r\nTPV: Take the fact that Kevin, who's averaging more than 20 points per game this season, started playing varsity as a sophomore and didn't play very much at all for a moment, and combine it with the fact that you're a freshman already integrated into Coach Sax's rotation. What does that right there say about what you can become?\r\n\r\nMD: I have really high hopes, honestly. Looking up to Kevin, who's a great scorer and a great team player, I really hope to one day exceed Kevin's playing ability. Right now, though, I'm just really focusing on developing and improving my skills.\r\n\r\nTPV: Outside of the school and the team itself, who has helped you the most get to this point?\r\n\r\nMD: Definitely my brother. I look up to him so much. He's been a great mentor to me, having played basketball his entire life, too. This in addition to other sports that he's played, as well. I really look up to him, and he's given me a lot of good advice.\r\n\r\nTPV: Best thing about high school so far?\r\n\r\nMD: Definitely the freedom. No question.\r\n\r\nTPV: Okay, then. What's the worst thing about it?\r\n\r\nMD: I would have to say Mondays. I just don't like the seven period schedule.\r\n\r\nTPV: What is one thing that Paly should know about you as the school gets to witness your growth and potential over the next few years?\r\n\r\nMD: I'm just a young player trying to develop and trying to be the next big guy during my senior year.\r\n\r\n<em>Dorward and the boys' varsity team is currently in first place in the De Anza League, with a league record of 7-2.
