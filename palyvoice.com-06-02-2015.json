They didn't let it get them down.\u201d\r\n\r\nJunior forward and defender Alison Lu also noted the team\u2019s successful\u00a0season but said there are a few things the team can do to reach its ultimate goal\u00a0of\u00a0winning the DAL and later the\u00a0Central Coast Section finals.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe've had many chances in front of the goal but haven't been able to capitalize on those opportunities,\u201d Lu said. \u201cWe're just going to keep practicing and work on starting games off strong. We sometimes start off a bit lackadaisical and have a few moments in the beginning where we don't have full control of the ball.\u201d\r\n\r\nPaly players currently lead the DAL in multiple categories, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.maxpreps.com\/league\/gJhb-VuN5kesTljiplLOEQ\/standings-scval---de-anza.htm#standings\" target=\"_blank\">Maxpreps<\/a>. Junior midfielder Jacey Pederson leads the DAL in goals with 20, while sophomore goalie Dhara Yu leads the league in fewest goals allowed per game, with an average of\u00a00.4. The team as a whole has scored 55 goals, while only allowing seven.\r\n\r\nSeedman noted the excellence of Pederson's performance but also attributed the team\u2019s success to a wide range of players, including Lu, senior Katie Foug and freshman Emily Tomz.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne of our best attributes is our depth,\u201d Seedman said. \u201cWe can put any player out on the field at any juncture and have confidence that they will more than hold their own. Most coaches don't have that flexibility.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith <a href=\"http:\/\/www.maxpreps.com\/rankings\/girls-soccer-winter\/1\/section\/ca\/central+coast+section.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Maxpreps<\/a>' standings placing the Vikings third in CCS, a playoff berth seems inevitable.\r\n\r\n\u201cCan we do it?\" Seedman said. \"Yes.

People are crowding doorways and streaming out the front door, sitting down on the carpet next to the podium and ducking under glaring camera lenses. There is a feeling of informality so typical of Latin America that it seems to band the whole group together under the weight and tension that accompanies the event. The event begins with a series of presentations, during which a father valiantly comes forward to share a few words with the group. We don't know the man any better than we know the rest of of the crowd, but we band together under his pain because his pain is our pain; his grief, the grief of all of Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis was a few months ago, I was attending a vigil at Stanford University at the Center for Latin American Studies to honor and inform people of the 43 missing students of Ayotzinapa, Guerrero. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.telesurtv.net\/english\/telesuragenda\/Justice-for-Ayotzinapa-20141014-0077.html\">According to South American television network teleSUR<\/a>, the students were arrested by Mexican police and then turned over to local drug gang Guerreros Unidos. When these students disappeared, a connection was drawn between the police who arrested them and the Mexican drug cartels. According to teleSur, authorities believe that the students were killed.\r\n\r\nOccurrences similar to this massacre have become common over the last 10 years in Mexico\u2019s drug war. However, this event has brought to light a connection between the Mexican government and drug cartels, serving as a wake-up call for not only Mexicans but people all over the world. Mexicans and non-Mexicans alike are saying \u201cbasta\u201d or \u201cno more\u201d to the death, the corruption, the disappearances and the abuse of power the Mexican government seems to wield.\r\n\r\nThe reaction to the disappearance of these students has exploded into a movement for social change across Mexico and the world, rallied by students of all ethnic backgrounds against the corruption of the Mexican government and its increasingly translucent connection with the Mexican drug cartels. Since the disappearances of the students in Ayotzinapa, there have been hundreds of non-violent protests all over Latin America, many of them still ongoing today.\r\n\r\nMore than 100 people attended the Stanford vigil, Hispanic and non-Hispanic alike. I was glad to finally see people in my community act. Being from Mexico, the Mexican drug war has always been an issue prominent in my life, and the overwhelming support from the Bay Area community was something I had yet to experience. I felt very moved and empowered by the event.\r\n\r\nIt's disappointing how little American news channels have covered the events in Ayotzinapa. At school, I was surprised by the fact I was one of the few people who knew about the tragedy and the movement for social change. It makes sense, coming from Mexico, that I be informed on this topic; however, it doesn't meant that everyone else in Palo Alto should be oblivious to a tragedy that is happening right next door, in a country whose border we share. After asking around, I was also surprised by our community's lack of education on the Mexican drug war in general and other drug wars happening all over Latin America\r\n\r\nThirty-eight percent of California's population is Latino, and towns in the Bay Area such as Redwood City and East Palo Alto have huge Latino communities. Yet, there is a profound disconnect between the United States and Mexico. Violence in Mexico is not really highlighted by the media, and as a result, the few times that these issues are discussed, it is often in blind ignorance. Perhaps this is caused by the distraction of events in the Middle East. Perhaps people believe it does not affect them, or perhaps the fact that violence is happening a road trip away makes them feel uncomfortable and vulnerable.\r\n\r\nRegardless of the reason, violence in Mexico is not often covered by American media. Real violence by real people in a very real proximity to the United States is often left ignored, and what doesn't appear on the screens or in the papers ceases to exist in the minds of the American people.\r\n\r\nThis has to change because these events affect more than just the families of the those 43 missing Ayotzinapa students. They affect your gardener, the guy who bags your groceries at Safeway, your doctor, that student who sits next to you in class, your nanny.\r\n\r\nWe should address these issues not as far off problems, but as issues deserving of our attention that affect us in in California, right here and right now, even if they're not highlighted by the media. We should give our Mexican neighbors the global support they deserve.","excerpt":"Staff writer Emilia Diaz-Magaloni shares her opinion on the absence of coverage on Mexican violence and protests in American media.

Math Department Instructional Supervisor Radu Toma, who served as the team\u2019s adviser, explained in a <a href=\"http:\/\/news.pausd.org\/post.cfm\/palo-alto-high-school-team-will-represent-the-united-states-in-international-mathematical-modeling-competition\" target=\"_blank\">press release<\/a> that these students \u201chave the stamina, determination and courage it takes to tackle and solve serious, real-life problems using sophisticated mathematical modeling\u201d and that \u201ctheir splendid performance is also a tribute to all the teachers who inspired and guided them over the years, opening their eyes to the beauty of mathematics.\u201d\r\n\r\n<b>Point B: Teen Poetry Jam provides platform for expression<\/b>\r\n\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_97415\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"350\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/unnamed.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-97415\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/unnamed.jpg\" alt=\"Junior Molly Kraus performs an original response to the phrase \u201cdaddy issues,\u201d a concept she thinks \u201cour culture likes to hypersexualize.\u201d The audience became emotional after her touching poem.

Founded by Paly sophomores Claire Eberhart and Teddie Stewart, the event aimed to be a place for teens to express themselves through poetry. Students were given access to the event, entitled <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/01\/22\/sildeshow-teen-arts-council-point-b-poetry-jam\/\" target=\"_blank\">Point B: Teen Poetry Jam<\/a>, which filled an absence of a place to express and share a love for poetry that was noted by Eberhart and Stewart. With the hope of continuing with future Poetry Jams later this year, students will be offered more opportunities to express themselves.\r\n\r\n<b>Prom to be held at San Francisco City Hall on April 18<\/b>\r\n\r\nWith ASB\u2019s Winter Rally <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/01\/15\/prom-2015-location-sf-city-hall\/\" target=\"_blank\">announcement<\/a> of this year\u2019s Prom location of <a href=\"http:\/\/sfgsa.org\/index.aspx?page=1085\" target=\"_blank\">San Francisco City Hall<\/a>, the \u201cprama\u201d and \u201cpromposals\u201d can officially begin.
