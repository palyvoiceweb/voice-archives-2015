Photo courtesy of Warner Bros.[\/caption]The title of the movie says it all: war, patriotism and of course, snipers. This war movie not only includes numerous fighting scenes, but also flashes of the life a soldier experiences and how far some soldiers are\u00a0willing to go for a country they love. \"American Sniper\"\u00a0tells the story through a unique perspective by taking a deep look into one soldier's experiences. However, while the movie reaches the expectations for a great\u00a0action movie and realistic war movie, it does not quite reach the goal of being the perfectly thought-out biography.\r\n\r\n\u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d is a true story based on Chris Kyle\u2019s autobiography as a Navy SEAL in Iraq after the United States declared war on terrorism. Kyle (Bradley Cooper) is a Texan cowboy who grew up with a father who taught him to classify people as\u00a0wolves, sheep and sheepdogs that protect the innocent. The childhood lesson resurfaces in Kyle\u2019s life when he joins the SEALs, after he decides it\u2019s time he did something more with his life. Kyle meets his future wife Taya (Sienna Miller) in a surprisingly lighthearted scene, and after some playful bantering and courtship, they marry before Kyle leaves for Iraq. The movie then proceeds to follows him through his four tours, over a hundred kills, his struggle to stay in touch with his wife and through his assimilation into society after losing friends along the way.\r\n\r\nDirector Clint Eastwood attempts to portray the reasoning behind the violence war requires by emphasizing the themes of vengeance against terrorism and the price good men pay in the fight against evil through Kyle\u2019s story. However, while there is a strong focus on Kyle\u2019s beliefs on the war and his duty, the lens Eastwood uses primarily provides justification for the war instead of focusing more on troubling consequences and opposing views.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_99197\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"643\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/americansniper26.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-99197\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/americansniper26.jpg\" alt=\"As a sniper, Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) protects the American soldiers moving through the Iraqi streets.

He eventually becomes the most efficient sniper in U.S. history. Photo courtesy of\u00a0Warner Bros.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe action scenes are\u00a0beautifully done with interesting camera angles and none of the overly loud and unnecessary music that can be distracting in a serious war movie. There are\u00a0also scenes flashing between Kyle\u2019s perspective and his wife\u2019s perspective during phone conversations that add strength and realism\u00a0to their relationship, which could have otherwise been easily overlooked. Bradley Cooper\u2019s transformation into a bulky, Texan soldier is\u00a0not only amazing physically, but it also remained unwaveringly realistic throughout the movie in a showcase of dedicated acting. As\u00a0Taya, Sienna Miller's emotions seem authentic, and her performance as\u00a0the worried wife helps the audience connect to the couple's struggles.\r\n\r\n\u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d provides a direct look into the lives of soldiers and a moving snapshot of their dedication to protect their country. The movie is not afraid to illustrate not only the struggles of the soldiers, but also the terrifying experiences of affected Iraqi citizens. As an action movie, it meets all standards. As a drama, it paints a gritty but also touching look into one man\u2019s life. Still, while it is a good and sometimes even thematically deep war movie, \u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d does not explore enough of the varying aspects of war issues to be considered one of the best war movies of all time.\r\n\r\n<strong>\"American Sniper\"<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>2 hours, 14 minutes<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Rated R for for strong and disturbing war violence, and language throughout, including some sexual references<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Directed by Clint Eastwood<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>With Bradley Cooper, Sienna Miller, Kyle Gallner<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Oscar Nominations: Best Picture, Actor in a Leading Role (Bradley Cooper), Adapted Screenplay, Film Editing, Sound Editing and Sound Mixing<\/strong>","excerpt":"The title of the movie says it all: war, patriotism and of course, snipers.

Photo courtesy of StudioCanal.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nIf you walk down the street and ask someone \"Who is Alan Turing?\" they probably would give you a blank stare or a puzzled expression. After watching \"The Imitation Game,\" viewers everywhere will know about Alan Turing and his life-changing position in helping to end World War II. \"The Imitation Game\" is an intense film set in the 1940s that depicts the turmoil of the time and within Turing's life while\u00a0still having all the necessary parts of a film, including humor, romance and high stakes.\r\n\r\nAlan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) is part of an elite group searching for the key to Enigma, the coding system the Germans utilized during World War II. Turing is a genius but is socially awkward as he cannot comprehend jokes or sarcasm, which often\u00a0causes difficulties between him and the other workers.\r\n\r\nThe humor in \"The Imitation Game\" is often very subtle and can be found in Turing's actions or in snarky comments from his team that completely pass over his head.\r\n\r\n\"The Imitation Game\" has three distinct plot lines, which give a more complete idea of Turing's life. The main plot line is Turing working on Enigma and creating \"Christopher,\" a machine that should solve Enigma and become a \"universal machine.\" The name \"Christopher\" has meaning to the audience because of the second plot line that focuses on his intimate friendship with his only friend Christopher Morcom (Jack Bannon) during high school. Everything gets tied together in the final plot line in which\u00a0Turing is exposed, not as a Soviet spy, but as a gay man, which was a crime in the United Kingdom until 1967.\r\n\r\nA British film would not be complete without Keira Knightley. Knightley plays Joan Clarke, who outdoes many of the men on the Enigma team and is Turing's closest confidant. Knightley is practically the only female character, but she is strong and refreshing. In order to keep Clarke on the Enigma team, Turing often goes above and beyond by lying to her parents about her \"secretarial job\" and even proposing to her, so she still fits stereotypical women's roles during the time period.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_99279\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"400\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/cdn.indiewire.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-99279\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/cdn.indiewire.jpg\" alt=\"Keira Knightley and Benedict Cumberpatch star in &quot;The Imitation Game.&quot; Knightley is the only star female character and outshines many of the other Enigma team members. \" width=\"400\" height=\"281\" \/><\/a> Keira Knightley and Benedict Cumberbatch star in \"The Imitation Game.\" Knightley is the only star female character and outshines many of the other Enigma team members. Photo courtesy of StudioCanal[\/caption]\r\n\r\nNot only is the film set in an incredibly tenuous time period, but Turing's sexual orientation also causes himself to be a target. Throughout the movie, the idea of his feelings toward Morcom build, and his homosexuality becomes a greater topic as the storyline escalates. The film itself is not about homophobia, but this definitely adds a more contemporary\u00a0importance to the film.\r\n\r\nThe costumes seem very well done and enhance the setting of the time period. Cumberbatch's performance was amazing, as the audience both loved him for his ideas but felt removed from him with his awkwardness. Even though the film is about a dark time in history, it\u00a0has plenty of happy and adorable moments. After Cumberbatch understands a clue of how to crack Enigma, the urge to stand up and cheer is undeniable.\r\n\r\n\"The Imitation Game\" is up for eight Oscar nominations. Best Picture, Actor in Leading Role and Actress in Supporting Role are just a few of the possible awards that we can expect from this film.\r\n\r\n<strong>\"The Imitation Game\"<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>1 hour, 54 minutes<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Rated PG-13 for sexual references and mature thematic material<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Directed by Morten Tyldum\u00a0<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>With Benedict Cumberbatch, Keira Knightley and Matthew Goode<\/strong>","excerpt":"Oscar nominee \"The Imitation Game\" features Benedict Cumberbatch as Alan Turing in a biopic about solving Enigma during World War II and preventing further violence.","date":"2015-02-22 17:27:30","author":"Alex Merkle-Raymond","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/ig2_0.jpg","categories":["Uncategorized"],"tags":{"39034":"benedict cumberbatch","39031":"best film","39033":"keira knightley","8900":"movie review","8930":"oscars","39032":"the imitation game"}},{"id":99270,"title":"Review: &#8220;Boyhood&#8221; captures audience and time","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/02\/22\/review-boyhood-captures-audience-and-time\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_99358\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"612\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/image.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-99358 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/image.jpg\" alt=\"boyhood image \" width=\"612\" height=\"380\" \/><\/a> Ellar Coltrane portrays the protagonist, Mason, in\u00a0\"Boyhood.\" Coltrane started shooting for the film at age 7 and finished acting in the final scene 12 years later. Photo courtesy of IFC Films.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nRichard Linklater's \"Boyhood\" is the coming of age story of a young man named Mason (Ellar Coltrane) from ages 5 to 18. The film was shot over 12 years of filming beginning in 2002. It is through this groundbreaking technique we experience Mason's transcendence into adulthood, as he matures and leaves for college, and simultaneously experience the cast and actor Coltrane maturing and growing with him.\r\n\r\nThe feat this film has accomplished is extraordinary and its message universal. It's extraordinary in the sense that the plot is very limited and consists of a series of snapshots of a life, a life that could be anyone's, and yet it is for this reason of simplicity that the audience is drawn in. We empathize with Mason and we see his life reflected in our own. The film's focus is on the passing of time, and as the story progresses we come to see how each character is affected by time, and how they overcome, or fail to overcome its unstoppable progression. Time has been spotlighted in other Richard Linklater's films, such as \"Before Sunrise\", \"Before Sunset\" and \"Before Midnight\". The three films follow a couple as they meet throughout the years and then are forced in each film to say goodbye, time never seeming to stand still for either of them.\r\n\r\nBoyhood does this on a larger scale. The film centers around Mason's family, mainly his father (Ethan Hawke) who left the family when Mason was young, his mother (Patricia Arquette) who left school to support her kids, his sister Samantha (Lorelei Linklater-the directors daughter) a bratty hyperactive elementary schooler and finally Mason, a thoughtful young boy who quietly observes the world around him. The film takes you through Mason's childhood, his parents divorce and then through his mother's failing relationships which force the family to start anew time and time again. From one home to the next, we watch how each new experience affects and changes the family members, and how time helps them recover and grow. Both Hawke and Arquette are remarkable in this film; their performance is raw and truthful. Likewise, Coltrane is able portray Mason with such dreamlike and wistful vulnerability that at the end of the film we are left praying and aching for Mason, hoping that everything will turn out okay for him. You grow to understand and love the characters wholly, and you leave the movie a little different than when you came in, with maybe a slight hint at an understanding of this unstoppable whirlwind called life.\r\n\r\n\"Boyhood\" is nominated for the following six academy awards: Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best Film Editing. I believe \"Boyhood\" deserves to win best Supporting Actress, Best Picture and Best Director.\r\n\r\n<strong>\"Boyhood\"<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>2 hours, 45\u00a0minutes<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Rated R for language including sexual references, and for teen drug and alcohol use<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Directed by Richard Linklater<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Staring Ellar Coltrane, Patricia Arquette, Ethan Hawke and Lorelei Linklater<\/strong>","excerpt":"Richard Linklater's \"Boyhood\" is the coming of age story of a young man named Mason (Ellar Coltrane) from ages 5 to 18.

It is nominated for five Academy Awards including Best Picture. Photo by Sony Pictures.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nDamien Chazelle\u2019s film \u201cWhiplash\u201d captivates\u00a0audiences with its talented cast, superb script and intriguing mood, garnering five Academy Award nominations. Despite this deserved success, the film falls slightly flat in terms of character development and realistic plotline.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhiplash\u201d stars \u00a0Andrew Neiman (Miles Teller), an ambitious jazz drummer enrolled in a prestigious New York music school. Neiman, initially accepted into the school band as an alternate drummer, is eventually promoted to the jazz band\u2019s core drummer. Conductor Terence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons), however, is abusive to his students, regularly ridiculing and mocking them during rehearsals. Teller\u2019s hopes of gaining Fletcher\u2019s approval soon turn into an obsession which rapidly spirals out of control.\r\n\r\nThe film serves as great entertainment and is captivating throughout. The cast of \u201cWhiplash,\u201d namely J.K. Simmons, effortlessly slide into character and evoke various emotions in the audience. Viewers easily connect with the protagonist and are engrossed by Teller\u2019s arduous journey as he struggles against Fletcher\u2019s harsh classroom rule. Teller\u2019s character traits continuously evolve in the film, allowing for a dynamic and sophisticated plot.\r\n\r\n\"Whiplash\" succeeds in other aspects as well. The movie\u2019s moderate length will not bore most audiences, and the entire film is well-edited as each scene flows on to the next. The script is well written and provides intricate plot twists which will no doubt surprise most viewers. Furthermore, a vague yet constant suspenseful tone combined with as a fast-paced soundtrack created an interesting mood throughout with a positive result.\r\n\r\nAlthough \u201cWhiplash\u201d has a large number of charming qualities, the film still faces a few problems as well. Character development is generally lacking in Simmons\u2019 character and viewers may be disappointed to find how little he has evolved at the end of the film. The plot can also be at times irritatingly unrealistic, forcing the audience to question Teller\u2019s motives throughout.\r\n\r\nDespite the negative aspects of the film, \u201cWhiplash\u201d proved to be an exciting and dramatic film with a colorful cast, alluring plot and intriguing tone which will do little to displease any audience.\r\n\r\n\"Whiplash\" is nominated for the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Film Editing and Best Sound Mixing. Although \"Whiplash\" is unlikely to win Best Picture, it has a chance to take home the awards for Best Supporting Actor, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Sound Mixing.\r\n\r\n<b>\"Whiplash\"<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>1 hour, 46 minutes<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>Rated R for <\/b><b>for strong language including some sexual references<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>Directed by Damien Chazelle<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>Starring Miles Teller, J.K.

I\u00f1\u00e1rritu\u2019s \u201cBirdman\u201d as a drama with stellar acting and widespread critical acclaim, but it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ve realized what the heck this admittedly strange film is about: a heartwarming, tumultuous and entertaining journey of self-discovery. Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) is an actor who once played a character called Birdman in a series of famous superhero movies. He is prominent for playing this role, but being the guy in the bird costume is not what he wants to be remembered for. In an attempt to revive his fading career, middle-aged Riggan develops a Broadway play that adapts a Raymond Carver novel to stage. With this play, he hopes to finally be recognized among true artists and leave behind the ghosts of his past.\r\n\r\nIt is an understatement to say that Riggan\u2019s play is having a hard time getting its feet off the ground. In order to help it become the success he envisions, Riggan replaces one of his lead actors with the eccentric Mike Shiner (Edward Norton), an actor whom theater critics love and is usually at least half naked. Riggan's problems are compounded as he deals with his highly aggressive daughter, Sam (Emma Stone), a recovering drug addict fresh from rehab who also acts as her dad\u2019s assistant.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_99278\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"400\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/Screen-Shot-2015-02-19-at-11.23.40-PM.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-99278\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/Screen-Shot-2015-02-19-at-11.23.40-PM.png\" alt=\"Riggan Thomson (Michael Keaton) being closely followed by his alter-ego, Birdman. &quot;Birdman&quot; has been nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture.

Photo courtesy of \u00a9 2014 - Fox Searchlight[\/caption]\r\n\r\nRiggan\u2019s utter desperation to turn his play into a bona fide work of art bleeds through the barrier of the screen and creeps into your seat. Keaton does a phenomenal job of navigating audience members through the thoughts of Riggan's deeply dysfunctional mind. In an especially memorable set of scenes, Riggan is visited by the hallucination of Birdman, his former self who mocks Riggan's current path and reminds him of his lost glory. (It is interesting to note that much like his character, Keaton has starred in two Batman movies.) These journeys through Riggan\u2019s mind are often accompanied by the idiosyncratic rhythms of percussive instruments, resulting in a jarring, surreal effect.\r\n\r\nThe characters in this film are seriously messed up, so naturally they deliver a ton of great lines. I\u2019ve never listened to so much profundity by insane people using obscene language. Edward Norton doles out some pretty thought-provoking stuff as Mike, and whenever Sam speaks something hilariously cynical is bound to come out. The humor keeps the film running at a pleasant, digestible pace.\r\n\r\nI\u00f1\u00e1rritu expertly takes the audience through the complexities of each and every one of the characters and lets the actors in this film shine. Every performance is raw, passionate and believable. Every detail on set is meticulously accounted for and perfectly blends in against the urban backdrop of New York City.\r\n\r\nThe camera work in this film has been highly recognized for following Riggan\u2019s movements in a way that\u00a0it seems\u00a0like everything was shot in one take. It must have taken a ridiculous amount of work and planning to ensure that each scene blends into the next, giving a unique and somewhat dizzying effect to the film.\r\n\r\n\u201cBirdman\u201d has been nominated for nine Academy Awards \u2014 Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Sound Mixing and Best Sound Editing. Keaton and Norton are favorites for their respective categories, and the film is a serious contender for Best Screenplay. For Best Director, most critics' decisions are split between I\u00f1\u00e1rritu and Richard Linklater, the director of \"Boyhood.\"\r\n\r\nSome might say that \u201cBirdman\u201d isn\u2019t for everyone, but I wholeheartedly disagree. Cinephiles will surely appreciate this film\u2019s technical achievements, while more everyday moviegoers will laugh at the dialogue, smile at the characters\u2019 successes and perhaps even tear up at times when things go south. If you care at all about family, the differences between perception and truth or the importance of dignity then there is a high probability you will find some sort of meaning in this groundbreaking film.\r\n\r\n<b>\u201cBirdman\u201d<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>1 hour, 59 minutes<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>Rated: R for language throughout, some sexual content and brief violence<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>Directed by Alejandro G.

The story begins as Hawking\u00a0(Eddie Redmayne) falls in love with Wilde\u00a0(Felicity Jones) at a New Year\u2019s party at Cambridge. However shortly after their relationship begins, he is diagnosed with Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease, also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, and is given two years to live. Wilde's\u00a0decision to continue their relationship results in an imperfect love story filled with hope, despair, confusion and inspiring perseverance.\r\n\r\nRedmayne delivers a stunning performance, conveying a host of emotions solely through facial expression for the second half of the movie, staying true to the physical limitations of Hawking\u2019s disability. Jones\u2019 portrayal of Wilde\u00a0is brilliantly imperfect; it preserves the authenticity of the story by not biasing the audience toward her character. The fact that both Stephen Hawking and Jane Wilde approve of this interpretation is a credit to the direction by James Marsh, who has successfully pursued realistic interpretations before with his direction of \u201cMan on a Wire,\u201d which won an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 2008.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_99371\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/x900.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-99371\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/x900.jpg\" alt=\"Felicity Jones and Eddie Redmayne star in &quot;The Theory of Everything&quot;.

Sequences of the film seem to be shot in a bluish filter, which compliment the cool palette seen in Wilde\u2019s blue dresses and Hawking's\u00a0suits, and ties into Wilde's description of Hawking\u00a0wearing a blue jacket on the night they met. The beautiful English landscapes and scenes from Cambridge successfully transport the audience to the era of each scene, and the revisiting of certain locations like Wilde\u2019s church and Hawking\u2019s parents\u2019 house help show each character\u2019s transition throughout the movie.\r\n\r\nThe choice to end the poignant film by having Hawking\u00a0revisit all of his memories traveling\u00a0back to his first kiss with Wilde\u00a0reestablishes the sentimentality of Hawking's\u00a0journey and leaves the audience feeling the irony of the fact that the man without enough\u00a0time was the first one to explain time to the rest of the world.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Theory of Everything\u201d has been nominated for Best Picture, Best Original Music Score and Best Writing Adapted Screenplay. The movie definitely deserves Best Picture and Best Writing Adapted Screenplay wins, but it may be a little undeserving of the Best Original Music Score because nearly the entire soundtrack is classical piano, and more versatility would have been appreciated. Redmayne and Jones have each been nominated for Best Actor and Actress for their performances.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Stephen Hawking\u2019s story is one that ought to be watched by anyone\u00a0who has ever doubted the resilience of man or believed that heroes come without flaws; \"The Theory of Everything\" shows that both Hawking\u00a0and Wilde\u00a0are such heroes. Though the reality of the Hawking's experience is often brushed over for the sake of the story and deep exploration of Hawking's\u00a0motivations for ending his relationship with Wilde\u00a0is lacking, this movie achieves what it sets out to do: tell a poignant\u00a0story of the strength of two people who, faced with seemingly unsurmountable challenges, rely on their passion and love of life to survive. Bitter for its reality, sweet for its message, \"The Theory of Everything\" is one of the greatest biopics of the year.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>\"The Theory of Everything\"<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>2 hours, 3 minutes<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b> Release Date: Nov. 21, 2014<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>Rated: PG-13 for some thematic elements and suggestive material<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>Directed by James Marsh<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>Starring: Eddie Redmayne, <\/b><b>Felicity Jones<\/b><b>, Charlie Cox, Emily Watson, Simon McBurney, David Thewlis<\/b>","excerpt":"A touching story about one of the world\u2019s most brilliant scientist\u2019s battle with a motor neuron disease, \u201cThe Theory of Everything\u201d is a movie about the beauty and tragedy of love and science.","date":"2015-02-22 15:50:16","author":"Maya McNealis","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/x900.jpg","categories":["Uncategorized"],"tags":{"39049":"eddie redmayne","39048":"felicity jones","39047":"james marsh","39052":"oscars 2015","39050":"stephen hawking","39046":"the theory of everything"}}]
