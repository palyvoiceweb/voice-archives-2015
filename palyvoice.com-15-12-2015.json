[{"id":113258,"title":"Before and after: Boys&#8217; soccer show off new haircuts","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/12\/14\/before-and-after-boys-soccer-show-off-new-haircuts\/","content":"<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Palo Alto High School boys\u2019 soccer team (5-0, 0-0) is sporting new haircuts this winter for its upcoming season. The tradition of giving first-year varsity players especially notable haircuts is regarded by some as hazing, but by others as a fun team-bonding exercise.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to senior goalkeeper Eli Friedlander, the tradition of giving team haircuts originated from the team's former preseason schedule full of Catholic private schools.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe idea is that we would have crazy haircuts to play them,\u201d Friedlander said. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creative measures are taken by the haircut givers, usually upperclassmen on the team, according to junior outside defender Neil Verwillow. First-year varsity players are given especially memorable\u00a0haircuts, though no one is forced to get a haircut.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThis year, some people tried to replicate professional players\u2019 haircuts such as Marco Reus,\u201d Verwillow said. \u201cI knew that if it was your first year playing varsity, a really bad haircut was given. No one is forced to get a bad one, and even if they [choose to get a haircut], they could stop and walk away at any point for any reason.\u201d\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\nAccording to Verwillow, the experience was positive and uniting for the team.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt's a very positive team building activity,\u201d Verwillow said. \u201cIt's fun to receive one [a haircut], and you can show it off as a token of making the varsity squad. Plus you get to wear a comfy beanie for a while.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Check out some of the first-year varsity players\u2019 haircuts before-and-after gifs below.<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_113477\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"180\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/IMG_5712.gif\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-113477\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/IMG_5712.gif\" alt=\"Before: Gif by Morgan Keller\" width=\"180\" height=\"320\" \/><\/a> After: Tracy with the \"Bungy\" style.

Photo by Dhara Yu.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In \u201cThe Displaced,\u201d which chronicles the lives of three refugee children, viewers meet Oleg, a Ukrainian boy whose village has been reduced to rubble; Chuol, who has fled with his grandmother in order to escape the strife in South Sudan; and Hana, a Syrian refugee seeking asylum across the border in Lebanon. \u201cVigils in Paris\u201d captures the mourning in the wake of the Paris terror attacks. And in the most recent feature film, \u201cTake Flight,\u201d you float above a city skyline, coming face to face with the year's most noteworthy actors while suspended in the clouds.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While apps compatible with Cardboard are already available on Google Play and the App Store, most of these involve video gaming. The NYTVR app,\u00a0on the other hand,\u00a0is marketed as a kind of journalistic supplement<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In reality, there\u00a0is not that much content on the app (each feature film is\u00a0less than 12 minutes long),\u00a0but I thought it was worth downloading just to get a taste of the virtual reality experience.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though it is certainly not the first large-scale foray into this kind of technology, the Times\u2019 VR experiment is unique because of its accessibility \u2014 all that\u2019s required is a smartphone, and if desired, an inexpensive cardboard apparatus. <\/span>\r\n\r\nThe Google Cardboard itself looks like a boxy pair of binoculars. To use it, you simply insert your phone in the front flap of the Cardboard and peer through the plastic convex lenses. You can actually watch content from the NYTVR without Cardboard, but naturally, it\u2019s a lot more immersive with the eyepiece.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_113524\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"402\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/IMG_2642.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-113524\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/IMG_2642.png\" alt=\"A screenshot from &quot;The Displaced,&quot; the NYTVR feature film that follows the lives of three refugee children. Photo by Dhara Yu.\" width=\"402\" height=\"226\" \/><\/a> A screenshot from \"The Displaced,\" the NYTVR feature film that follows the lives of three refugee children. Photo by Dhara Yu.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe experience is truly remarkable. You hear the refugee children give harrowing testimonies of struggle and loss \u2014 yet manage to find fleeting moments of happiness \u2014 as you look around and survey the desolate landscape. The emotion is palpable when you witness the somber gatherings at the scenes of the attacks. And there is something exhilarating (albeit maybe a bit nauseating) about drifting away into the sky.\r\n\r\nThat being said, the app does have some technological issues. For the Cardboard viewing setting, the stereoscopic effect is somewhat finicky, so you end up having double vision if your screen isn\u2019t perfectly aligned with the eyepiece. Also, the screen quality is disappointingly low, so the films appear somewhat grainy and pixelated. It's marginally better in non-Cardboard mode.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For now, at least, virtual reality technology for the masses remains in an inchoate stage, and practically speaking, NYTVR is more of a novelty than a journalism staple. But there\u2019s something enticing, even transcendent, about the notion of experiencing life through an entirely different lens \u2014 and that is the value in the app.\u00a0<\/span>","excerpt":"In another installment of The Paly Voice's APPetite blog, Opinion Editor Dhara Yu reviews NYTVR, the New York Times app that aims to transform the journalistic experience as well as make virtual reality technology more accessible.

Looking over this older information is important\u00a0because unlike unit tests, you have to remember a lot more content. Don't fret, because even though you think you've forgotten most of the material, the information will come back quickly.\r\n\r\nAccording to junior Nadia Leinhos, using a review sheet is really helpful.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI think it [reviewing old notes] can be helpful, but I find it most helpful when it's coupled with some sort of review sheet,\u201d Leinhos said.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>2. Quiz yourself:<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you have started reviewing material for your finals, one of the best ways to test your knowledge is to\u00a0quiz yourself. This enhances learning and will put you in a similar situation to finals. A great resource is the flashcard app <a href=\"https:\/\/quizlet.com\/\">Quizlet<\/a>\u00a0because it saves paper and it is easier to carry around. However, writing down information is scientifically proven to help you learn better, so you could also use paper flashcards. If you want others to quiz you, you can also ask family\u00a0and\u00a0friends.<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_113303\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"320\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/FullSizeRender-6.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-113303\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/FullSizeRender-6.jpg\" alt=\"Sophomores Devin Ardeshna and Charlie Baldwin help each other study for their classes.\" width=\"320\" height=\"290\" \/><\/a> Sophomores Devin Ardeshna and Charlie Baldwin help each other study for their classes.

Talk to teachers:<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Classes will most likely be reviewing for the final\u00a0starting sometime this\u00a0week. However, if there are still unanswered questions about the material or the test itself, don't be afraid to individually ask or talk to your teachers for help or advice. Go in during Tutorial or make an appointment with them. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to junior Georgina Wu, teachers are great at answering\u00a0clarifying questions.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cTeachers are able to answer my questions,\" Wu said. \"It's definitely better than asking a classmate because they know the material fully.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>4. Don't cram the night before:<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is extremely important. Do not leave all your studying for the night before. Finals almost always cover the semester in its entirety, so it's impossible to review everything in one night, no matter how quickly you look over the lessons. Trying to relearn all the information the night before never allows students to fully reabsorb all the information. Spreading out your studying material throughout the week or weekend before is the best way to cover all the material. You could either go over lessons multiple times or review a few sections of the class each day. You can also make yourself a\u00a0schedule to\u00a0plan out your study schedule in order to\u00a0avoid saving\u00a0everything for the\u00a0last day.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/Screen-shot-2015-12-09-at-8.57.12-PM.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-113200\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/Screen-shot-2015-12-09-at-8.57.12-PM.png\" alt=\"Screen shot 2015-12-09 at 8.57.12 PM\" width=\"620\" height=\"318\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\n<b>5. Take a break:<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, studying for finals is extremely important. However, don't let the idea of finals week consume your entire life. It is essential to take breaks, go outside and have fun. Holing yourself in your room all day\u00a0won't always help you. Taking study breaks and getting your mind off the upcoming week is one of the best ways to destress. Go for a walk or watch an episode of your favorite TV show. That being said, don't slack off the entire time. The most important thing is to balance the right amount of time between studying and taking breaks. Although you should be prepared for your\u00a0tests, you should not\u00a0stress over them too much.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\nSenior Gabrielle Bains thinks that taking a break is extremely important for being mentally prepared for finals.\r\n\r\n\"<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You should take lots of breaks so that you don't get overstressed or overwhelmed or have anxiety,\u201d Bains said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>6. Come to school with necessary materials:<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students are often so focused on their tests and the result is that they forget or don't think about the important things that are necessary to get through finals week. Many only bring a drawstring bag because of the low amount of school supplies they need for finals. However, don't forget to pack that bag with the right materials. Make sure to bring pencils and other materials your classes require. The most important thing, though, is to bring lots of water as well as a full lunch. Going hungry in the middle of a test can be very distracting.<\/span>\r\n\r\nAlso, make sure you're\u00a0comfortable. Finals week is not a fashion show, so do not feel pressured to dress nicely during this week. However, there are two routes you could follow\u00a0(<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/12\/16\/trendy-tuesday-finals-fashion\/\">check out a previous Voice article for finals fashion tips!<\/a>): either wear sweats, hoodies or pajamas so that you\u2019re as relaxed and comfortable as possible during the test, or you opt for\u00a0nice clothes because it might give you a boost of confidence and thus help you\u00a0perform better. So, whatever you think you would feel best in, set it out the night before and throw it on the morning of the test.\r\n\r\n<b>7. Come to school physically ready to take tests:<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting a good night's rest and eating a healthy breakfast are two of the best ways to be prepared for finals. Both are important for any regular school day, but on finals it is absolutely vital. Don't give in to the temptation to study all night the day before one of the tests. Study during the day and go to bed at a reasonable time.\u00a0You will be\u00a0well rested for the testing period which will\u00a0therefore allow you to focus fully on the testing without any distractions or tired minds. Eating a large breakfast is also essential. We\u2019re told over and over that breakfast is the most important meal of the day, but that especially applies to finals week. Don't come to\u00a0school hungry because that will mess with your mind and your ability to take tests.<\/span>\r\n\r\nMost importantly, do not stress out too much. In most cases, finals are not going to change your grade that much and at the end of the day, grades do not define you. Please make sure to take care of yourself and take breaks throughout this stressful time. Also, just remember that once finals are over, <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/12\/10\/ways-to-enjoy-winter-break-without-going-on-vacation\/\">Winter Break begins<\/a>.","excerpt":"Here are seven helpful tips on how to ace your finals.","date":"2015-12-13 17:30:22","author":"Aisha Chabane","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/FullSizeRender-6.jpg","categories":["Features"],"tags":["ace","break","breaks","finals","grades","materials","quiz","School","studying","teachers","tips","winter break"]},{"id":113035,"title":"A cold reality","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/12\/13\/a-cold-reality-ap-style-dont-capitalize-cold-or-reality\/","content":"One of the most common problems associated with Palo Alto\u2019s high-pressure environment is the mental health of its students. But what about the physical health of the students?\r\n\r\nEvery flu season, classrooms are filled with sniffling, coughing and constant throat clearing.\r\n\r\nThe main cause of these symptoms? The common cold. According to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/features\/rhinoviruses\/\">Center for Disease Control<\/a>, the average adult gets two-three colds each year. It\u2019s so common that we\u2019re used to it, so we take some medicine, drink liquids and take a couple days off from school.\r\n\r\nThat was routine up to middle school.\r\n\r\nNow, in high school, taking a sick day can potentially leave you struggling to catch up with the classwork and homework you missed. Of course, the workload depends on which kind of classes you\u2019re taking. In some classes you might be able to get away with missing a day or two. But there are other classes, like Advanced Placement Biology or AP United States History, where missing a day can mean falling behind.\r\n\r\nIt's this pressure that forces students out of bed when they're sick to attend classes even when they shouldn't. It just goes to show how much of an unhealthy emphasis Palo Alto High School has put on academics.\r\n\r\nPaly nurse Jennifer Kleckner agrees that students push themselves too hard.\r\n\r\n\u201cStudents who fear that they will fall behind, and see their dreams put at risk, often prefer to struggle through the day at half strength,\u201d Kleckner said. \u201cIt\u2019s folly, because their illness drags on longer, their work is not as strong as it could be if they invested in their recovery and they spread their viruses to others.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s this kind of environment that creates the worst situations for spreading viruses. Because of the severe consequences of missing class, students often get out of bed and drag themselves to school, only stopping when they physically can\u2019t go.\r\n\r\nI conducted an unofficial survey across the sophomore, junior and senior classes to see how students felt about coming to school when sick. The survey, which was posted in the respective class Facebook pages, netted 179 responses. While the results may have only come from a small section of Paly, it serves as a rough base of evidence.\r\n\r\nAccording to Kleckner, the school criteria for not attending class ranges from frequent coughing and a sore throat to vomiting and temperatures above 100 degrees.\r\n\r\nWhen asked what it would take for students to not come to school, 41 percent said puking, 31 percent said a fever, 11 percent said hospitalized and 8 percent said a cold.\r\n\r\nWhen asked if they felt pressure to come to school when sick, 81 percent said yes.\r\n\r\nWhile the data is only from a small section of the student body, the implications from it are alarming. The majority of the students surveyed are willing to come to the school when sick. This isn\u2019t only detrimental to their health, but also the health of the students around them.\r\n\r\nBy having so many sick students come to school, they risk infecting their classmates and staff members. While this is commonly attributed to\u00a0catching a cold and spreading it, what happens if there is a particularly bad strain of flu going around? People may think it's just a cold and continue going to school, all the while spreading the bug to more and more people.\r\n\r\nAn example of this is the swine flu outbreak in 2009. According to an article written by <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2009\/11\/05\/node-21903\/\">The Paly Voice<\/a>, 136 students were marked as sick. On one day. So many students missing classes is heavily disruptive to teachers and students alike. With so many students missing, most teachers have no choice but to re-teach material they previously covered, and the more days that the students miss, the larger the workload that builds up, further adding to the already heavy workload.\r\n\r\nThis is the problem with Paly\u2019s environment. It not only is mentally detrimental, but physical as well. No sick student should feel pressure to come to school, this drive to not fall behind.\r\n\r\nExcept we do.","excerpt":"One of the most common problems associated with Palo Alto\u2019s high-pressure environment is the mental health of its students.
