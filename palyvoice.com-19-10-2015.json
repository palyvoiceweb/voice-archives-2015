Cheung attributed his success to his teammates.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was mainly just the team,\u201d Cheung said. \u201cThe team just really pulled through and I was there at the right time.\u201d\r\n\r\nCheung felt that the team was ready and confident to close out the game.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe knew we were going to win,\u201d Cheung said. \u201cWe knew we just had to play hard and we just had to grind it through to the end.\u201d\r\n\r\nSophomore Andrew Jozefov also chipped in with three goals. He described the importance of the game to the De Anza League standings.\r\n\r\n\"If we didn\u2019t win this game, it would be impossible for us to outright win leagues,\" Jozefov said. \u201cBecause we won this game, the league title is now a toss-up. Also, it is a rivalry game and we just can\u2019t lose those.\"\r\n\r\nThe Vikings won despite falling to Gunn earlier in the season. Coach Brandon Johnson felt that the team benefitted from mid-season tactical adjustments.\r\n\r\n\"We made a lot of adjustments coming out of last game [against Gunn] through this middle leg of the season,\u201d Johnson said. \u201c We have made a lot of defensive adjustments and started making that our main focus. We have also started using our physicality to our advantage.\"\r\n\r\nThe game saw many lead changes and a close finish. Cheung, Jozefov and sophomore John Anderson all scored big goals in the fourth quarter to hang on to the win for Paly.\r\n\r\nJozefov is optimistic for the team and hopes that they can build on their win.\r\n\r\n\"It gives us extra motivation to finish off the season strong because now we have a chance at the league title and it's always a confidence booster to beat out cross town rival,\" Jozefov said. \"Now we know the level that we can play at we just need to focus on being consistent and if we can do that, we'll have a good shot at not only the league title, but the CCS [Central Coast Section] title.\"\r\n\r\nThe Vikings' next game will be Tuesday at Gunn High School against Monta Vista High School.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School boy\u2019s water polo team (10-10, 7-2) beat their crosstown rival Gunn High School (12-3, 4-1), 10-8, in an important and nail-biting game on Thursday at Gunn High School.","date":"2015-10-18 19:11:24","author":"Chirag Akella","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/BoysWopoVSGunn151510.jpg","categories":["Sports","water polo"],"tags":["boys water polo","cheung","gunn","johnson","jozefov","vikings","water polo"]},{"id":110046,"title":"Preview: Spirit Week to commence with &#8220;Theme Day&#8221;","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/10\/18\/preview-spirit-week-to-commence-with-theme-day\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_110066\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"598\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/DSC_01971.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-110066 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/DSC_01971.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_0197\" width=\"598\" height=\"297\" \/><\/a> Class of 2016 ASB representatives\u00a0show off their spirit at \"Theme Day\" last year, dressing as pirates.

The Titans scored three goals in the first quarter, creating an uphill battle for the Vikings.\r\n\r\nWith three minutes left in the fourth quarter, Viking senior Katie Francis scored a powerful long shot. The score brought Paly to a one goal differential, 3-4, and gave the players a boost that helped overcome their fatigue.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings' push during the last quarter created a lot of opportunities. Junior goalkeeper Joanna Falla initiated a final play by heaving the ball across the pool to junior Haley Chalmers, creating one last opportunity to tie the game. Unfortunately, the shot went too wide.\r\n\r\nVikings head coach Aileen Delaney said\u00a0that the team played well but made errors.\r\n\"We need to get more consistent,\" Delaney said. \"In the first half we had a lot of up and downs where we needed to be consistent.\"\r\n\r\nDespite the loss, Chalmers maintained high hopes.\r\n\"I think it went really well, even though we lost I think we fought till the end,\" Chalmers said. \"We brought it back in the last quarter.\"\r\n\r\nGunn head coach Mark Hernandez said that the Paly Vikings have a lot of talent, and are well coached.\r\n\"Palo Alto is a very good team, they play very tough,\" Hernandez said. \"We made a few adjustments from last time we played them and it worked out for us.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the second time Paly has played Gunn this season, with the Paly Vikings winning their last meeting, 6-5.

The Scorecard then provides a list of schools that includes both 2-year community colleges and 4-year universities.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the College Scorecard is to give college-bound seniors more information about prospective colleges.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy administration [the Obama Administration] will release a new \u2018College Scorecard\u2019 that parents and students can use to compare schools based on a simple criteria \u2013 where you can get the most bang for your educational buck,\u201d President Barack Obama said in his 2013 State of the Union Address.\r\n\r\nThe College Scorecard website emphasizes financial statistics for average annual cost, graduation rate and salary after attending. A user-friendly slider bar filters search results so students can determine the desired ranges for the three categories. However, though these statistics are useful, Palo Alto High School College Adviser Sandra Cernobori says most of the numbers can be found through other websites. The website does not contain data about admission statistics.\r\n\r\nThe information on Scorecard may also be potentially misleading and not representative of the Paly community, according to Cernobori.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt [the Scorecard] reports the [predicted] salary [after graduation],\u201d Cernobori said. \u201cOn the surface, people might think that it\u2019s reporting across the board, but it\u2019s only reporting for those students who received federal aid which at Paly, is a small portion of the population. \u2026 It might be a little misleading.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn general, research is essential when applying to colleges, according to Cernobori.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn my experience, students don\u2019t often do as much digging into figuring out matches as I think that they should,\u201d Cernobori said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to play a more active role in your search, don\u2019t let your college be an arranged marriage.\u201d\r\n\r\nCernobori recommends looking at colleges holistically to find a school that fits each individual student.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t let someone else\u2019s opinion dictate your list,\u201d Cernobori said. \u201cIt\u2019s fine if you want to consult rankings, but that should be one piece of information.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Cernobori, students should know how college rankings are derived, the majors offered, rigor, academic versus social fit, culture of the campus, clubs, greek life and sports to better understand the schools.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_109525\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"566\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/Screen-Shot-2015-10-08-at-10.44.19-AM.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-109525\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/Screen-Shot-2015-10-08-at-10.44.19-AM.png\" alt=\"The College Scorecard should be supplemented with other tools, according to Cernobori.\" width=\"566\" height=\"262\" \/><\/a> The College Scorecard website is highly user-friendly.

According to its website, the ranking considers the college experience, overall assessment, financial success, overall happiness and graduation rate as the components of its methodology.\r\n\r\nThe College Navigator website, a federally funded site run by the National Center for Education Statistics, is a search tool that includes a great variety of search options.

Plus, it provides students with an idea of how they will do on the real test, along with their necessary areas of improvement.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Read on for seven helpful tips\u00a0to keep in mind for the PSAT.<\/span>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Study the booklet.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Use the booklet, handed out during advisory, to get a sense of what the PSAT will be like. It contains practice problems and a thorough description of what each section entails. Reading the instructions will save you time on the test and will allow you to directly start answering the questions. Familiarize yourself with the types of questions so you won\u2019t be surprised on the actual day.<\/span><\/li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Eat healthily.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Having a nourished body will allow you to focus on questions without thinking of your hunger. Remember, the new PSAT lasts 2 hours and 45 minutes, slightly longer than the old version. Because students are not allowed to bring food into the testing center, eating a good breakfast beforehand will prevent you from feeling hungry before it is over.<\/span><\/li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Pack the night before.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Juniors are advised to wake up slightly earlier on Wednesday to report to their special testing room (posted in the Student Center and Guidance Office windows). Bring multiple #2 pencils, a student ID and an <a href=\"https:\/\/collegereadiness.collegeboard.org\/psat-nmsqt-psat-10\/taking-the-tests\/test-day-checklist\/approved-calculators\">approved\u00a0calculator<\/a>. Pack the night before to avoid rushing in the morning and being tardy, which may ban you from taking the test.<\/span><\/li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Get lots of sleep.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Sleeping well before the PSAT will ensure that you are well-rested. Don\u2019t make careless mistakes by skipping or misreading questions!<\/span><\/li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Relax.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Some students may find it useful to take a moment to meditate and regulate their breathing before the exam. Take a minute or two to forget your surroundings and envision yourself taking practice PSAT tests. Dedicating this small portion of time to relaxation can have a large payoff by improving your ability to focus.<\/span><\/li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Pace yourself.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0Learn the number of questions per section and the time allotted. According to the <a href=\"https:\/\/collegereadiness.collegeboard.org\/psat-nmsqt-psat-10\">College Board<\/a>, the Evidence-based Reading section has 60 minutes to complete 47 questions while the Writing and Language section gives you 35 minutes for 44 questions. The Math calculator section has 31 questions long and is 45 minutes long, while the no calculator section has 25 minutes for 17 questions. With this in mind, you\u2019ll be less likely to fall behind or rush and make careless mistakes.<\/span><\/li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Guess!<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Unlike the old PSAT, the new test has no guessing penalty. Take advantage of this feature to gain\u00a0some peace of mind if you encounter a question you don\u2019t know the answer to by guessing instead.<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With these tricks\u00a0up your sleeve, hopefully you will be able to perform better on the PSAT. Good luck tomorrow!<\/span>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"The Paly Voice is here to give the Class of 2017 updated information and advice on how to perform well on the new PSAT, administered tomorrow.","date":"2015-10-13 22:28:26","author":"Adrienne Kwok","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/DSCN2175.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":["advice","allison","ally","changes","do","junior","juniors","new","nmsqt","october","psat","shih","study","tips","well"]},{"id":109673,"title":"Tuesday Tunes: The iconic Bungarden","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/10\/13\/tuesday-tunes-the-iconic-bungarden\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_109674\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"501\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/final-bungarden.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-109674\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/final-bungarden.jpg\" alt=\"final bungarden\" width=\"501\" height=\"533\" \/><\/a> Advanced Placement United States History teacher John Bungarden holds a Yoda doll while in his classroom.

In previous years, it was mandatory for students to participate in\u00a0certain activities pertaining\u00a0to college.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe've changed this from the freshman and sophomore activities from last year because we wanted students to choose what they felt they needed to do on this day and wanted to give them the gift of time to do complete these academic tasks,\u201d Kim said.\r\n\r\nAccording to the attendance office, attendance won't be taken for the new system.\r\n\r\nSeniors will also have the option of attending a multitude of workshops that are designed to help them with the college application process. The workshops include a question-and-answer session\u00a0about the application process, guidance with University of California and California State University applications, information on community colleges, help with college interviews, an informational about managing money and assistance with college essays.\r\n\r\nAccording to Kim, the senior workshops were kept because of their past success.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe still wanted to offer the senior workshops as they have been well-attended and appreciated by seniors in the past,\u201d Kim said.\r\n\r\nAs for juniors, they will be taking the PSAT.
