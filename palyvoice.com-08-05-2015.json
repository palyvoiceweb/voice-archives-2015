Palo Alto High School's robotics team, however, breaks\u00a0this stereotype, having an\u00a0art team that has been working hard throughout the year, designing graphics, winning the\u00a0Underground Society of Animator's competition in April and hosting animation classes for students.\r\n\r\nTo some students, it may come as a surprise to learn that the robotics team has an art division.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Team 8 [Paly] Robotics Team has\u00a0the traditional teams you would think of when working on a robot: like programming and building,\u201d art team member and junior Peter Turnbull said. \u201cHowever, we also have the art team.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis year, especially, the art team\u2019s importance and responsibilities has grown within Team 8.\r\n\r\n\u201cI expanded\u00a0the animation team to a whole art division,\u201d senior and art team captain Griffin Bajor said. \u201cThe graphic design team creates things like posters, shirts, and flags to make us [the robotics team] look as professional as possible; the sketching and storytelling team brainstorms the ideas, and creates the storyboards for the animators to use; [and] the animation team creates full 3D animation to model.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn addition to animating and designing, members of the art team also have the chance to hone a wide range of skills.\r\n\r\n\u201cOur role as the art team is to attract creative individuals across Paly and give them a place to use their skills to add to robotics, or too learn new completely skills,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cThese artists become exposed to the engineering minds [and] a very real-world work environment for an amazing experience for everyone. Students can range from having no experience at all to being masters of their craft.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis season, the team worked on an entry for the Underground Society Animator\u2019s competition.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe USA Competition was our focus from January to April,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cThe idea is that all the teams competing receive the same narrative prompt, and they have to accomplish it in a short animation. We were challenged to somehow, \u2018Tell the story of an insect that somehow causes the robot uprising\u2019, in 1 minute.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor their entry, the team<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=djbOAmS1TRM&amp;list=PL2U4HKGu4qvGfu_ycvxPobJu4MTWp6CAl&amp;index=2\"> created an animation<\/a> about an ant that was training for a marathon, according to Turnbull.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe won the Technical Award, which is\u00a0first place, and a $1000 prize, \"\u00a0 Turnbull said. \"It was a very bumpy road, filled with procrastination and cutting scenes that we didn't expect to,\u00a0but I am incredibly proud of the work that everyone on the team put in, and I'm so happy to be a part of this team. Winning feels pretty good.\"\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_103250\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"556\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015_USA_Award_Team_0008_TECHNICAL_AWARD.gif\"><img class=\"wp-image-103250\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/2015_USA_Award_Team_0008_TECHNICAL_AWARD.gif\" alt=\"2015_USA_Award_Team_0008_TECHNICAL_AWARD\" width=\"556\" height=\"313\" \/><\/a> The\u00a0art team\u00a0created an animation about an ant training for a marathon for the USA competition. \"To us this animation hit every note,\" the judges said. \"It had well done character animation, nice use of lighting and textures, and it had a cohesive story. Well done team.\" Video Courtesy of Paly Robotics.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nMoving forward, the entire robotics team is transitioning into new leadership roles, while the animation team will also be teaching animation classes.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are in the process of\u00a0training members and working on our recruitment and intake process for next year,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cArt team specifically, we are teaching two mini-classes for animation. The Intro class [started last week with] robotics members, [and] some from outside the robotics team, and the Advanced Animation class \u00a0starts after the Intro class ends.\r\n\r\nThe team is looking forward to next year and using the experience it has gained this year to improve.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe learned so much from this latest animation, \u201d Bajor said. \u201cI can't wait to see for next year's competition. We made something that was great, and it's incredibly important that each of us in the team remember that. There will be more competitions to compete in, more poster to make, webcomics to draw and so much more. Next year is going to be fantastic.\u201d","excerpt":"When people think of robotics, they think of math, science, and computers, not art.

The stakes are high, as this game determines the No. 2 seed versus the No. 3 seed in the upcoming playoffs.\n\nAlthough there is not a major rivalry between the two teams, senior team captain Zach Levitan is excited for a rematch after losing to Mountain View earlier this season.\n\n\"We only had four starters due to either injury or other conflicts,\" Levitan said.&nbsp;\"They [Mountain View] have been in our league since the beginning, and we always look forward to playing them.\"\n\nTo add to the already competitive nature of the game, current Paly coach DJ Shelton was previously an assistant coach at Mountain View.\n\nAs the last league and home game, there will be a Senior Night celebration before the game at 6:45 p.m. The 11 seniors on the team will be lauded for their high school lacrosse achievements, and their future plans will be announced.\n\nLevitan highlighted the gravity of playing on Senior Night.\n\n\"To play your final game at home under the lights is a big deal,\" Levitan said. \"Senior Night's&nbsp;always a fun time, especially when we win.\"\n\nThe Vikings are looking forward to the league playoffs. In addition to the benefit of winning No. 2 seed, the winner of the game will gain home field advantage for the semi-finals, according to Levitan.\n\nThe Viking senior boys who are graduating are Jon Rogers, Ethan Jorasch, Zach Levitan, Maclean Mansfield, Jack Stephenson, Michael Beisheim, Scott Andrews, Owen Staiger, Eric Whitson, Josh Torres and Ricardo Huerta.","excerpt":"The Paly boys' lacrosse team will take on the Mountain View High School Spartans at 7 p.m. tonight at the Paly lacrosse field.
