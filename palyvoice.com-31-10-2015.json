The data points revealed that historically underrepresented racial group students at Palo Alto high schools score significantly lower than those of Caucasian or Asian ethnicity.\r\n\r\n\u201cIncreasing achievement for underrepresented minorities is a high priority,\u201d board member Ken Dauber said. \u201cBut we need to do more, including improving how well curriculum and teaching meets the needs of all students and examining how well laning is supporting students in increasing achievement.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Minority Achievement and Talent Development committee, created earlier this year, is working with elementary schools to combat the issues of struggling students as early as kindergarten and first grade. MATD is providing increased access to support resources for students and their parents, according to Judy Argumedo, the PAUSD director of Academic Supports\r\n\r\nIn\u00a0addition to establishing\u00a0the MATD committee, the school board members also implemented early literacy and math after school programs for non-native English speakers at the Hoover and Fairmeadow elementary schools in order to help students catch up at an early age.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve talked to a lot of historically underrepresented racial group parents whose kids are struggling in math,\" school board president Melissa Caswell said. \"I believe that if you wait until middle school, you\u2019ll never be able to catch up.\"\r\n\r\nThe board members also discussed the necessity of changing the overall climate surrounding Advanced Placement courses. The board emphasized the importance of encouraging all students to take advanced classes and providing them with access to a more rich education through these courses.\r\n\r\n\u201cSome kids in our district may feel intimidated by the APs, thinking that they are only for a select group,\u201d board member Camille Townsend said. \u201cThis should become a continual focus that our that kids take at least one AP class, so they gain confidence in themselves.\u201d\r\n\r\nCaswell emphasized that the board will be focusing on improving the quality of education across all the schools within the district.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe need to ask [ourselves], \u2018Are we providing advanced topics to enough of our kids?\u2019\u201d Caswell said.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto Unified School District Board of Education plans to take action to improve school climate and decrease the achievement gap of historically underrepresented racial groups within the school district.\r\n","date":"2015-10-29 21:44:38","author":"Sherwin Amsbaugh","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/IMG_4144.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["achievement gap","ACT","AP testing","Camille Townsend","ken dauber","Melissa Caswell","sat"]},{"id":111002,"title":"Football takes on Homestead in Senior Night","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/10\/29\/football-takes-on-homestead-in-senior-night\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_111004\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"581\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/I9P6770.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-111004\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/I9P6770.jpg\" alt=\"_I9P6770\" width=\"581\" height=\"387\" \/><\/a> Sophomore running back Paul Jackson III runs the ball during the Palo Alto High School Homecoming game last Friday.

Considering the long way and all that these refugees endured, I have so much respect for each and every one of the Syrian refugees.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\nAfter witnessing the refugee\u00a0crisis firsthand, Graham believes that countries should be more heavily involved in saving lives.\r\n\r\n\"Take refugees into your country, provide them with the basic necessities and make them thrive,\" Graham said. \"Train them to be able to work, so they can support their families, so the cycle of poverty doesn't either continue or begin. Even just letting them pass through all of the European countries so they can reach their destination could be better than putting up barricades and putting them through more emotional, physical and mental pain.\"\r\n\r\nBut one does not have to be located in Western Europe to provide a helping hand. Students and adults alike can offer their assistance worldwide.\r\n\r\n\"I would recommend helping out any type of humanitarian group, and in any way possible, because the satisfaction of seeing all that one group can accomplished was beyond mesmerizing,\" Graham said.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">If you would like to join the thousands of people that are a part of the movement to help, feel free to visit any of the following sites: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2015\/sep\/03\/refugee-crisis-what-can-you-do-to-help\">The Guardian<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.unrefugees.org\/can-help\/\">Unrefugees<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.savethechildren.org\/site\/c.8rKLIXMGIpI4E\/b.7998857\/k.D075\/Syria.htm\">Savethechildren<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rescue.org\/crisis-syria\">Rescue.org<\/a><\/span>\r\n\r\nHere's to the start of a better world.","excerpt":"The second installation of \u201cBlogger without borders,\u201d a blog by junior Bianca Al-Shamari that details her gap semester in Austria from September 2015 to January 2016.","date":"2015-10-27 11:25:25","author":"Bianca Al-Shamari","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/Screen-Shot-2015-10-15-at-5.15.48-PM.png","categories":["Blog","Blogger without borders","Spotlight"],"tags":[]},{"id":109856,"title":"Voice of the Week: Chelsea Mclntosh","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/10\/26\/voice-of-the-week-chelsea-mclntosh\/","content":"<em>This week, the Paly Voice sat down with senior Chelsea Mclntosh to learn about the her passion for bananas, running\u00a0and her cat. <\/em>\r\n\r\nThe Paly Voice: Tell us about yourself.\r\n\r\nChelsea McIntosh: I really like bananas, I\u2019m vegan and I enjoy singing, running and yoga.\r\n\r\nTPV: Why bananas?\r\n\r\nCM: They\u2019re delicious, practical,\u00a0great and really delicious.
