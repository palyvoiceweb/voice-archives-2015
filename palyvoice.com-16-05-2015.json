Halas says Paly only narrowly won its last match against Los Altos.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re two equal teams, so this is basically to see who stays in the upper division,\u201d Halas said before the game. \u201cThis is basically our whole season right here.\u201d\n\nAccording to Halas, Tuesday\u2019s match was delayed about an hour and a half because the Los Altos team originally went to Gunn High School instead of Paly and had to arrange for a bus to take them to the correct location. Halas says the Los Altos team mistakenly thought the construction of the new Paly Gym had already started and that all Paly home games were now at Gunn.\n\nBefore the match, the team organized a surprise Senior Night celebration for seniors Joseph Chang, Daniel Cohen-Wang, Alec Deng, Promise Lee, Matthew Li, Anthony Liu and Dan Su.

It\u2019s a good team atmosphere, which is why people like to coach.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Halas, the team will improve next year because of playing experience gained this year.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re a young team so there\u2019s not much leadership,\u201d Halas said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of sophomores and juniors that are kind of rebuilding here. So I think that next year, once we get the team back,\u00a0there will be a lot of senior leadership and we will be able to have a title next year.\u201d\r\n\r\nVarsity badminton\u00a0junior Priya Misner says that although the team has strengths, there is still room for improvement.\r\n\r\n\u201cI guess one of our strengths is that we are a really good team and people are very versatile, so they can play many different positions,\u201d Misner said. \u201cThe one thing that we need to improve on is consistency because some games we play really well and we beat teams that our track record would say we wouldn\u2019t be able to beat, but sometimes we lose to teams that we all think we should be able to win against.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Paly badminton team will play its final game at 3:30 p.m. today at Monta Vista High School.\r\n\r\n<em><span style=\"color: #373e4d;\">Editor's note: This article has been changed to read that Senior Night was played against Los Altos High School.<\/span><\/em>","excerpt":"As the badminton season winds down, the team reflects on the success of this season and their expectations for next year.","date":"2015-05-14 14:42:37","author":"Ana Caklovic","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/photo-2.jpg","categories":["Sports"],"tags":{"44425":"badminton team","44426":"coach justin halas","8912":"new","44427":"next season","8944":"palo alto high school"}},{"id":104127,"title":"Liveblog: Boys&#8217; Lacrosse SCVAL semifinals vs Mountain View","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/05\/13\/liveblog-boys-lacrosse-scval-semifinals-vs-mountain-view\/","content":"<address>The Palo Alto High School boys' lacrosse team <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\u00a0(<\/span>16-9-1, 5-6)\u00a0will face Mountain View High School Spartans (15-12<span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">\u00a0,\u00a0<\/span>5-4) in the Santa Clara Valley Athletics League semi finals at 7:30 p.m. on the Paly\u00a0lacrosse field.
