Teams were required to solve a real world problem relating to the field of mathematics.\u00a0The contest was held during mid-March and ended early-May, and during that time, teams chose five consecutive days to work and collaborate on the assigned problem.\r\n\r\nThis year, teams were asked to design a model for effective filming and production of a motion picture.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe modeled movie scheduling, taking into account variables such as actor availability, prop\/set construction time and traveling costs,\u201d Zhang said.\r\n\r\nIn an email to the Palo Alto High School faculty, Toma praised the team for its achievement.\r\n\r\n\"This is the highest award Paly students have ever earned in mathematics,\" Toma said. \"I am absolutely blown away by their accomplishment and humbled both to have had them as students. This award is a tribute both to these students' exceptional talent, work ethic, determination and love of mathematics, and to all their past mathematics teachers who have taught, inspired and mentored these kids over the years.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Zhang, the team is very excited to hear that\u00a0they won the international competition on behalf of the United States and Palo Alto High School.\r\n\r\nMembers of the team were shocked when they found out they had won, according to Lee.\r\n\r\n\u201cHonestly, it was a bit of a surprise,\u201d Lee said. \u201cWe actually were not 100 percent confident in our paper when we submitted it. Even in the last couple hours, we were rushing to proof-read and complete it.\u201d\r\n\r\nBecause of their accomplishments, the team and Toma are invited to Hong Kong in July to receive an award. In addition, three other high schools from Beijing, Singapore and Shanghai are also invited to this ceremony.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe other three team members and I cannot wait to travel to Hong Kong for the awards ceremony,\" Zhang said. \"This contest is especially significant to us because it encourages high school students to solve relevant real world problems through applied mathematics.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"A team of four juniors in Advanced Placement BC Calculus are invited to Hong Kong in July for their success in the International Mathematical Modeling Challenge contest on Monday.

Although we\u2019re all still very young, I do feel like there is one very important lesson I\u2019ve learned so far that is worth sharing.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">What I\u2019ve learned is that we need to confront and prepare for the fact that over the course of the next four years (and the rest of our lives) there are going to be people who are critical of us and the things we do. I know that many of us, including myself, have received a lot of support and praise but in college and in the real world, our parents aren\u2019t always going to be there to pat us on the back and say \u201cGreat job honey.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Now I learned this lesson the hard way one summer at a filmmaking camp.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I came in to the camp intending to learn how to make emotional films and develop as an artist but was told that instead of art, what I had been making before was merely \u201centertainment.\u201d (A little bit of context: The movie that got me into this camp was about a talking cat; that\u2019s the type of filmmaker I was).<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Here\u2019s the problem though: I really liked making movies about things like talking cats and before this camp other people had also really liked them. But my film camp teachers were not amused by talking cats.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">And the moment I realized that they didn\u2019t like what I did, I tried super hard to win their approval. I watched my peers soar to new creative heights as I stood by helpless, weighted down by doubt and insecurity. I\u2019m not going to lie, the films I did make at the camp were pretty darn bad. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">In four weeks, I went from making quirky comedies to instead attempting to create interpretive filmography about haikus. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I languished miserably and it was an absolutely devastating experience. I didn\u2019t make another film for five months afterwards. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I\u2019ll pause my story for just a minute. From my understanding of things, nearly everyone who eventually does something they\u2019re really truly proud of seems to have this moment of crisis. A time where you doubt yourself; where you look around and see other people doing things better than you; where you question whether or not you\u2019re good enough; whether you are worthy.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I mean, look at Elvis: The first time he performed, he was told he would be better off going back to being a truck driver than a singer. Or J.K. Rowling. She was rejected 12 times before someone agreed to publish Harry Potter. And of course there is Walt Disney, who was fired from his first job because he \u201clacked imagination and had no good ideas.\u201d The list of successful people who were originally told that what they were doing wasn\u2019t good literally goes on forever.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Anyway, as I was saying, I left pretty devastated from that summer camp. I thought about it for a long time and one day I realized that during the camp all those films that I made were simply constructions of what I thought other people, my teachers, wanted to see. I never made anything that I was passionate about. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The difference between Elvis and me is that Elvis stuck with his vision and didn\u2019t change it when somebody suggested otherwise. I tailored my vision to what I thought someone else wanted.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">When I finally realized this, it was like a eureka moment. The best way to recover from my months of misery, I figured, was to simply cast it all away and go back to working on things I was passionate about. So then I thought, what is it deep down in my heart of hearts that I want to make? And then it came to me: I\u2019m going to make a movie about a competitive eating prodigy. A young boy striving to become a hot dog eating champion. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Let me tell you something: The most fun I have ever had in my life was making this movie. Dozens and dozens of hot dogs were consumed, pies were swallowed and asparagus was slurped. I was also humbled by the fact that many of my friends and their parents were willing to step in and help me out. After weeks of shooting, I had my movie. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">And you know what the best part was? I was making that movie for nobody but myself.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Needless to say, I regained my love of making movies and became a much better filmmaker in the process. Now I know all of us have different interests, whether in theater or STEM or writing or athletics or robotics or something else entirely, but I think we all need to remember that when we\u2019re doing something we love, that we feel passionate about, we can\u2019t look to other people for validation. Instead, we need to look inwards and think: Is what I\u2019m doing going to make me happy? Is it something that I\u2019m doing for me, and not for someone else? <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Don\u2019t try to be somebody that you\u2019re not. Don\u2019t quit at what you like to do. It\u2019s up to you to decide whether or not what you\u2019re doing, or what you want to do, is worthy. And if you haven\u2019t found your passion yet, dare to explore and don\u2019t turn back if someone sneers or makes fun of you. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"color: #222222;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Even if you want to make videos about talking cats and hot dog eating prodigies.<\/span><\/p>","excerpt":"The Paly Voice acquired senior Jack Brook's speech that did not get chosen for Graduation, with his consent to publish.","date":"2015-06-04 12:07:49","author":"Adele Bloch","categories":["Uncategorized"],"tags":[]},{"id":105615,"title":"The speeches that didn&#8217;t make it, Class of 2015: Part II","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/06\/04\/the-speeches-that-didnt-make-it-class-of-2015-part-ii\/","content":"<em>The Paly Voice\u00a0acquired the following speeches from their authors, with their authors\u2019 consent to publish.

I arrived in Palo Alto less than two years ago, moving from New York City, and the place itself has already impacted me way more than I could have ever imagined. I had never had an Asian friend before.(pause) and now some are my best friends. I was welcomed very warmly into the Paly community only a few weeks into school, when half of the Junior and Senior grades came over to my house while my parents were out of town... Sorry Dad. But it was well worth it as I met the people who would become my best friends for the remainder of high school. Paly has recently received a ton of criticism and bad press after the tragedies that occurred over the past year, but we cannot forget what a great place this actually is. Over these past two years I\u2019ve definitely learned a thing or two to take with me after I graduate.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, these 4 years of high school are not going to be the best 4 years of your life, I don\u2019t even wish that upon my worst enemy. If getting on the wheel in Ceramics class is part of the best 4 years of your life there is something seriously wrong. That being said High School is a very unique time, and nothing will ever be like it. As you get older, you mature. You begin to feel less infallible, your desire to be independent is tempered by the reality of actually being independent and all the responsibility that comes with it. You will never have the mindset you had in High School again. I remember telling my parents that when I turned 18 that I would never listen to them again. I am 18 now and have been for nearly 6 months and I cannot even come close to imagining not having them in my life. Everyone going to college next year will come to that realization when you\u2019re actually going to have to wash your own clothes and change your bed sheets more than once a semester. Paly has helped me become the independent person I am today and one that will surely survive without his parents perched on his shoulder for the rest of time.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m sure every student here has a teacher that pushed him or her to succeed and do their best throughout these 4 years. Personally, I don\u2019t think I can single out just one and that\u2019s something that\u2019s extraordinary about this school. Everyone wants you to do well and get to the next level, and that isn\u2019t just teachers, students want to help you too. We have a great community here and I\u2019m going to miss it dearly next year.\r\n\r\nSince my early days at Paly I\u2019ve had the same group of friends by my side, and that is something I wouldn't trade for the world. Even though we fight and argue sometimes, mostly about whether to go to Driftwood or Chipotle during lunch, I couldn\u2019t imagine finishing my high school career with any other guys. When my parents decided to move out west from New York I was devastated. Leaving a place where I have lived for sixteen and a half years just suddenly. I vividly remember bawling my eyes out in front of my mom the night before our flight out as I was convinced that nowhere besides New York would ever be home. But I am more than glad to say I was mistaken, and Palo Alto has definitely become a home to me.\r\n\r\nI wanted to thank my mom, dad, and most of all my brother Will for helping me get to where I am today. My brother has taught me so much and has been my role model throughout my entire life. Even though you thought I was the golden child and that mom and dad liked me more than you, I have always been jealous of how much smarter and talented you are than me at pretty much everything, except for Madden, I could still whoop you any day. I also wanted to thank\u00a0all my classmates and teachers for an amazing two years here and wish you all the best in the future.

In an email to the Paly staff, parents and students, Principal Kim Diorio announced that the school day would be extended 15 minutes to give students the allotted two hour time slot for their final exams.\n\nAccording to Berkson, the alarm originated in the Student Center. The fire alarm control panel can detect where the alarm was triggered and if smoke or a manual trigger set off the alarm. Additionally, the Palo Alto Fire Department is automatically notified when the fire alarm goes off.\n\n\"As soon as I saw that it was pulled, I called them [PAFD] to say that it was a non-emergency,\" Berkson said. \"But they still have to reset everything. We can't just reset it.\"\n\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">The <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/12\/04\/can-you-take-the-heat-think-twice-before-pulling-that-fire-alarm\/\">consequences of pulling a fire alarm<\/a> in&nbsp;the absence of a fire can be serious.

It was a typical regular season league game, and the Vikings uneventfully fell short by a score of 6-1. It was during the last inning when the Vikings, having been out-dueled all game offensively by the pitching of Bruins phenom Kathryn Caravalho, finally showed signs of life for the first time. \r\n\r\nFreshman first baseman Sophie Frick worked the count full against Caravalho, who prior to the at-bat had only allowed two hits in the game. Even though her team trailed by six runs, Frick continued to persist by fouling off multiple pitches. On the eighth pitch of the at-bat, she ripped a double down the left-field line, knocking in the first run of the game for the Vikings, her teammates and coaches applauding. She's been doing that kind of thing all season. \r\n\r\nPlaying on a team with 10 upperclassmen, it would be natural to assume that Frick wouldn't receive the starting job at first base and a spot in the middle of the order. But after an impressive performance early in the season, her manager Bill Laskey did just that. \r\n\r\nAs it turns out, Frick isn't just good at softball. In the fall, she helped lead the girls' water polo team's push into the CCS playoffs. Later, she became a part of Coach Scott Peters' eight-player rotation, playing key minutes throughout a championship season for girls' basketball. She also finished in the top three on the softball team in hits (18), runs batted in (14), and batting average (.316), according to MaxPreps.com. \r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_104992\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"590\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/11303970_1602089120038641_1694026943_o.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-104992\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/11303970_1602089120038641_1694026943_o.jpg\" alt=\"Freshman Sophie Frick looks to pass to a nearby teammate in a home water polo game against Mountain View.

Maybe two. Playing three sports year-round in high school is a feat that requires not just athleticism, but patience, determination, and a consistently assiduous attitude. What about three sports, all at the varsity level, as a <em>freshman<\/em> in high school? Is that even sustainable? \r\n\r\nFor Frick, it's more than just possible. It's a lifestyle. Palo Alto High School's next super-athlete is loving every moment of Paly sports. \r\n\r\n\"I don't know if I could just pick a favorite [sport],\" Frick said in a recent interview. \"My favorite is the one that I'm playing at the time during the season.\"\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_105043\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"335\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/11304157_1602089183371968_1945597461_n.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-105043\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/11304157_1602089183371968_1945597461_n.jpg\" alt=\"Frick participates in a summer softball tournament during 2013.

Photo by Jeff Frick.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe time management required to juggle high school academics and overlapping sports games and practices has always been a part of Frick's teenage lifestyle.\r\n\r\n\"I've been used to the timing [of playing multiple sports],\" Frick said. \"I did the same thing in middle school where I was playing a sport throughout every season, so I'm definitely used to the time management and doing homework when I have free time especially. It hasn't been that hard this year, and it definitely helps with managing my time.\"\r\n\r\nFrick began playing sports at an early age, beginning with basketball, and baseball as well, during kindergarten. According to Frick, she played little league baseball until fifth grade before switching over to softball in sixth grade, the year that she was introduced to water polo. Both of her older siblings, Andrew, a current freshman at Claremont McKenna College, and Maddie, a sophomore at Paly, have experience playing sports in high school. \r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_105027\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"393\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/11267042_10153408011083413_2787173618381490382_o.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-105027\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/11267042_10153408011083413_2787173618381490382_o.jpg\" alt=\"Frick began her playing career at a young age, participating in little league baseball in kindergarten before transferring to softball in sixth grade.

I also love the feeling of winning and making a team. I think it's really cool how teammates form and how close a team comes together.\"\r\n\r\nThroughout the year, Frick acted in a very mature manner for a freshman. Despite a minimal amount of playing time in certain sports, she maintained a positive attitude and focused more on team success, not just her own.\r\n\r\n\"The hardest part of this year was probably during basketball season when I did not play very often for stretches,\" Frick said. \"I got a\u00a0good amount of minutes during the regular season primarily, which I was very happy about. It was during practice when I would just try to continue to be a team player and not get down on myself or others as well.\"\r\n\r\nMany of Frick's teammates, including junior water polo player Katie Francis, acknowledged her outgoing personality and supportiveness, especially in practice.\r\n\r\n\"Sophie is very fun to be around and has a bubbly personality,\" Francis said. \"She is a very supportive teammate and pushes you hard in practice, which is good for the team.\"\r\n\r\nOther teammates expressed Frick's positivity and ability to get along with teammates easily. \r\n\r\n\"She is very supportive of all of us, especially bringing people up and our spirits up when we are down,\" freshman basketball guard Carly Leong said. \"She brings positivity by being the best teammate a person can have.\"\r\n\r\n\"She is super easy to get along with and is so friendly and outgoing that she fit right in with our team,\" junior Maddy Atwater said, a basketball and softball teammate of Frick's. \"She was a great teammate on the court and an even better friend off the court.\"\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_98904\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"711\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/IMG_8696.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-98904\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/IMG_8696.jpg\" alt=\"Frick warms up behind the three-point line prior to a game vs. Gunn High School.

It was nice to go in right after basketball and start right away, knowing that the coach trusted me and the team trusted me to do what I could as a freshman. It did mean a lot to start and bat in the middle of the order even with a lot of the older players on the team.\"\r\n\r\nWhen asked if Frick looked up to a particular teammate, the first name that came to mind was a basketball teammate, junior guard Courtney Lovely.\r\n\r\n\"Coco is an overall extremely positive, well-rounded person and obviously a very good basketball player too,\" Frick said.\r\n\r\nGiven her noteworthy talent, Frick says she hopes to play all three sports for as long as she can. While nothing can take away her hard-working, focused and caring attitude, Frick says that only the hectic nature of high school would prevent her from competing for\u00a0the\u00a0duration of all four years.\r\n\r\n\"As of right now, I am hoping to play for as long as I can; hopefully all four years,\" Frick said. \"I know that it gets busy as a junior with SATs and as a senior with college apps, so if I feel overwhelmed I will probably step out of one or two sports. That being said, I really hope I will continue to manage my time well enough so that I can play all three sports throughout high school.\"\r\n\r\nWhen she's not practicing or competing, Frick is passionate about music and television, especially when it involves her siblings.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_105040\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"189\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/11297661_1602089340038619_538719075_n.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-105040\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/11297661_1602089340038619_538719075_n.jpg\" alt=\"Frick protects the ball as she squeezes between defenders in a game against Mountain View.

I have a lot of shows that I'm always up to date with.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Frick, her primary goals for the next few years are to establish strong bonds with teammates. As for looking beyond her time at Paly, Frick says that playing in college would be a dream come true.\r\n\r\n\"I pursue sports for obviously the awesomeness of school legacy and to win championships and building teams that you'll remember for the rest of your life,\" Frick said. \"I would also love to play a sport in college if I ever get the opportunity. I think it would be really fun and really pursuing a dream.\"\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"After participating in water polo, basketball and softball during her first year in high school, freshman Sophie Frick looks poised for a number of athletic accomplishments in the near future, marking herself as the Paly Voice's athlete of the year.
