Students could pop in or leave or stay... and just talk directly to the principle and superintendent about things that they've noticed in their time in this district and things that adults should focusing their efforts on.\"\r\n\r\nASB President Claire Liu agrres with Diorio about the importance of being able to speak directly to the administration.\r\n\r\n\"It's important overall that students are voicing their concerns and making sure that people who actually have the power to change things are listening to them,\" Liu said. \"With what's been going on in our community, it's an especially crucial time for students to speak up... It's a time when students' voices can be most powerful, too.\"\r\n\r\nLiu adds that in order to make an impact in the Paly and Palo Alto community students must take the initiative by showing up to the event.\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing but positive outcomes for this event,\" Liu said. \"I think it's just a matter of students taking the initiative to come to the MAC on Thursday. ... It will be a great way for Mrs. Diorio and Mr. McGee to see students personally and hear their stories \u2013 that is the most impactful thing that students can do.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a chance for the administration and faculty to understand the issues that students are facing, according to McGee.\r\n\r\n\"'Seek first to understand, then be understood,'\" McGee told The Paly Voice, quoting Stephen Covey. \"From the position of the administration and faculty, we need to understand the issues that are really important to the students ... [and] not just assume what they [the issues] are because we are teachers and parents.\"\r\n\r\nDiorio also\u00a0expressed wanting the students to be heard more so than the adults.\r\n\r\n\"A lot of times what happens is you have adults at the table,\" Diorio said. \"And although every adult is well-meaning and well-intending, we have to make sure we are including our students in the conversation and that they are really leading this conversation.\"\r\n\r\nMcGee said that moving forward, the community needs to become increasingly more collaborative when dealing with issues such as student stress and other school climate concerns.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\"I think the inclusive piece is really important,\" said McGee. \"Edicts don't come from the top down. ... They're made in collaboration and shared meaningful dialogue. ... We are going to do more listening than speaking.\"<\/p>\r\nDiorio said that this forum is to be a positive experience for students and the community.\r\n\r\n\"We just want this to be a positive experience,\" Diorio said. \"We want it to be an opportunity for people to feel like they are being part of the solutions and that if they have an idea or they have something they want to talk about ... it would be a good opportunity for people to come forward.\r\n\r\nWhile ideas and opinions presented at this forum will be considered by the administration, Diorio noted that it will take time for the administration to respond.\r\n\r\n\"It might not happen overnight,\" Diorio said. \"It might not be a quick fix, but we are certainly going to take the input that we receive at this forum and bring it back to our community ... so that we can all work together in partnership to support kids.\"\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"Student forum to be held at 7 p.m. this Thursday in the MAC.

Photo by Nika Woodfill.\" width=\"612\" height=\"408\" \/><\/a> The recent measles outbreak in the United States has raised some fears about public health safety, especially in schools, where unvaccinated children could potentially be exposed the the measles virus. Photo by Nika Woodfill.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nA <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/measles\/cases-outbreaks.html\">recent measles outbreak<\/a> that has affected at least 141 people across 17 states, including <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cdph.ca.gov\/HealthInfo\/discond\/Pages\/MeaslesSurveillanceUpdates.aspx\">two\u00a0in Santa Clara County<\/a>, has sparked a national conversation about the importance of vaccinations in maintaining public health.\r\n\r\nSomething of this magnitude, the reemergence of a potentially life-threatening disease, would usually generate much public discourse in Palo Alto. But alas, save for the occasional diatribe found on Palo Alto Online\u2019s Town Square, our reaction to the outbreak has been pretty subdued. After all, we\u00a0Palo Altans have been <em>entirely <\/em>responsible\u00a0when it comes to getting our shots, and as <em>rational, highly scientific beings<\/em>, completely acknowledge the necessity of vaccinations in preserving public health. We all know that it\u2019s really just the uneducated, impoverished, and\/or religious fundamentalist demographic groups that refuse to get their kids vaccinated and essentially allow infectious diseases to proliferate in the population.\r\n\r\nBut that\u2019s not true.\r\n\r\nContrary to popular belief, the anti-vaccination movement is most prevalent in wealthy, educated and generally liberal enclaves. Take, for example, the cities of Santa Monica and Beverly Hills. In these affluent suburbs, droves of parents have filled out personal belief exemptions, or PBEs, meaning that their children\u00a0can attend school despite not having the required shots because they have a moral objection to the vaccines. According to an an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hollywoodreporter.com\/features\/los-angeles-vaccination-rates\/\">expos\u00e9 written by The Hollywood Reporter in 2014<\/a>, close to 70 percent of parents have submitted personal belief exemptions in certain Southern California private schools, making the vaccination rates at those schools lower than those found in some developing countries.\r\n\r\nThankfully, the percentage of unvaccinated kids in Palo Alto is not even close to those frighteningly high numbers, and several schools in PAUSD \u00a0have a perfect or near-perfect vaccination record. That being said, data shows that there is a minuscule, surreptitious anti-vax movement within our city, and we need to pay attention.\r\n\r\nAccording to information from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.shotsforschool.org\/k-12\/how-doing\/\">ShotsForSchool.org<\/a>, an affiliate of the California Department of Public Health, approximately six percent of kindergarteners at Addison Elementary School in Palo Alto are inadequately vaccinated because their parents have submitted PBEs. This number seems laughably insignificant, but with a disease as infectious as measles, these few unvaccinated children could pose a serious threat to\u00a0other students, especially those with compromised immune systems who, for medical reasons, cannot be vaccinated. Individuals with weak immune systems are highly susceptible to contracting illnesses, and have virtually no defense against disease. If I was a parent of a child who cannot receive the proper shots for medical reasons, I would, rightfully so, be very scared about this measles outbreak.\r\n\r\nWe believe ourselves to be an enlightened and progressive community; the importance and infallibility of science is stressed by a great many. Yet somehow, there are people who apparently spurn medical facts (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/vaccinesafety\/Concerns\/Autism\/antigens.html\">vaccines do NOT cause autism<\/a>) and potentially put people\u2019s lives in jeopardy. Beyond being just plain wrong about the science behind vaccinations, anti-vaccination folks\u00a0are morally negligent and show a wanton disregard for both their children's health and the general wellbeing\u00a0of the public.\r\n\r\nThough its proponents aren\u2019t vocal, nor is it widely accepted, the anti-vax movement has somehow seeped into Palo Alto. This goes to show that even a city heralded as an epicenter of technological progress\u00a0isn\u2019t immune to the dogma of this illogical campaign.\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of Palo Altans dutifully take their children to the doctor\u2019s office for the proper shots and willingly comply with medical requirements, but in some ways, it seems almost as if we\u2019ve forgotten what damage infectious disease can inflict upon us. After years of relative safety and no large-scale epidemics (other than the largely underground HIV\/AIDS epidemic) in the United States over the past few decades, infectious disease is no longer at the forefront of our minds. In fact, we seem to be amnesic when it comes to maladies: The 1918 Spanish influenza outbreak, the most devastating pandemic in the history of mankind, is but an obscure blurb in a dusty history textbook. Polio, smallpox, tuberculosis and other dastardly diseases that terrified and crippled the U.S. population less than a century ago are rarely mentioned, even by medical practitioners. Advances in medicine over the past 50 years or so have successfully assuaged our fears, and as a result, we\u2019ve become almost ignorant of the horrors brought about by infectious disease.\r\n\r\nIn our never-ending race to innovate, and\u00a0move society forward scientifically, we sometimes lose sight of the past. It\u2019s imperative that we continue to progress but remain cognizant of our history. We can\u2019t forget why we get shots and work actively to improve medicine: T0 protect ourselves, to the best of our abilities, from the indiscriminate onslaught of germs.\r\n\r\nThis current measles outbreak is a formidable reminder that a select few in one of the most highly educated and affluent communities -- our community -- are rejecting well-established medical claims in favor of rhetoric from anti-vax demagogues. But more importantly, the rise in measles cases across the United States demonstrates that we haven\u2019t conquered disease; clearly, we have quite a bit of work to do as a nation if we want to avoid future public health disasters. Those of us who have been properly vaccinated have already solved part of the problem. The next step is to move away from our\u00a0collective sense of complacency. I'm not saying that we need to go out and\u00a0start\u00a0what would essentially be a witch-hunt for all people who may be opposed\u00a0to vaccinations. What we do need to do is\u00a0acknowledge that infectious disease has not been eradicated, and be more aware of the fact that\u00a0it poses a very real threat to our livelihood.","excerpt":"In light of a recent measles outbreak that has affected at least 141 people across 17 states, including two in Santa Clara County, staff writer Dhara Yu weighs in on public health issues which plague our community.","date":"2015-02-24 13:50:09","author":"Dhara Yu","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/DSC_0001.jpg","categories":["Opinion","Spotlight"],"tags":{"39059":"anti-vaccination movement","39058":"anti-vax","39061":"disease","39056":"infectious disease","39055":"measles","8927":"opinion","39060":"outbreak","8939":"palo alto","8944":"palo alto high school","8977":"PAUSD","39057":"public health"}},{"id":98589,"title":"From a #SSS: Narrowing your college list","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/02\/24\/from-a-sss-narrowing-your-college-list\/","content":"As second semester seniors (a.k.a. #SSS), we have begun to reflect back on our high school experiences and look to pass along helpful advice and lessons we have learned.\r\n\r\nFor Palo Alto High School juniors looking toward next year, the college application process may seem like it's looming over your\u00a0heads. Narrowing your college list is the first step in what can be a long, and arduous process. Finalizing which colleges and universities you wish to apply to can take months, so it\u2019s best to start as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nHere are a few tips that we found helpful in narrowing down our own lists:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><b>Check out or buy college books<\/b><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nThere are close to 4,000 colleges in the United States, which can be extremely overwhelming. Luckily, a good way to dip your toes into the ocean of colleges is to start flipping through a college guide book, such as the \"Fiske Guide to Colleges\" or The Princeton Review's \"The Best 379 Colleges.\" These books offer an overview of many schools, various stats and some insight into student life. You can get a sense for what schools are out there and what you want in a college by skimming through the books and picking out attributes that appeal to you. These books can be purchased in bookstores and online or rented out for free at the College and Career Center or at a local library.\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><b>List out attributes<\/b><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nAfter getting a sense for what's out there, it's a good time to focus in on what you specifically want. One of the strategies that worked well for us is to divide the attributes we were looking for into two categories: must-haves and like-to-haves. Those under the must-haves would be deal-breakers (such as the student body size or location of campus), whereas those under like-to-haves are things you could see yourself living without (such as having a good football team or the type of weather on campus). There are many Internet resources that will give you suggestions based on requirements you input like <a href=\"https:\/\/connection.naviance.com\/family-connection\/auth\/login\/?hsid=pahs\">Naviance<\/a>\u00a0and <a href=\"https:\/\/bigfuture.collegeboard.org\/college-search\">The College Board<\/a>. There are also sites like <a href=\"https:\/\/colleges.niche.com\/\">College Prowler,\u00a0<\/a>which host reviews from actual students at that school.\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><b>Seek out advice<\/b><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nIf you start getting lost in the sea of college info that\u2019s out there, it may be time to talk to a professional. Luckily, that\u2019s exactly what the College and Career Center counselors are there for. All college-bound Paly juniors are recommended by their advisers to schedule a meeting with their corresponding C&amp;CC counselor \u2014\u00a0something we recommend being on top of, since the meeting time slots fill up quickly. These meetings can help focus your college list with their realistic advice and give you a different perspective on your college process so far. Paly grads are also good resources regarding the college process and are usually happy to give their advice if you reach out to them. Some may also choose to hire a private college advisor if they want additional services.\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><b>Visit colleges to get a feel for different kinds of campuses<\/b><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nIt\u2019s one thing to read about a college, but it's a whole other thing to actually experience a college. Knowing how you feel on a campus and getting placed in that environment can help you narrow down what you like in a college. You don\u2019t even have to go out of the Bay Area <span style=\"color: #252525;\">\u2014\u00a0<\/span>there are a variety of colleges within driving distance, such as Santa Clara University (27 minutes from Paly); University of California, Berkeley (59 minutes); Stanford University (5\u00a0minutes); and San Jose State University (32 minutes). Even if you aren\u2019t interested in that particular college, going to visit can help you understand how you\u2019d feel on a campus of that size, with that size of student body and in that environment. Sitting in on a class can also be invaluable in getting a feel for the classroom dynamics <span style=\"color: #252525;\">\u2014<\/span>\u00a0there are a range of styles from large lecture halls to smaller, discussion-based classrooms. Since this is a place you may hope to attend for a couple of years you want to know what the education you will be getting will be like. We recommend choosing a weekend or break to visit a variety of colleges.\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><b>Choose a variety<\/b><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nWe have all heard of the Ivies and the top 25 colleges in the country, but there are so many great colleges out there to choose from <span style=\"color: #252525;\">\u2014<\/span>\u00a0many you probably have never even heard about before. We recommend that you choose colleges because they have attributes that appeal to you, like a unique major or great school atmosphere, and not solely because of the name. That being said, dream big, but you should definitely have reasonable back ups. Also, don\u2019t overlook or underestimate safety or match schools. Naviance is a great tool to compare your academic statistics to former\u00a0Paly students who applied to schools you're interested in. Remember, these statistics are only a part of the application, but they are a great starting point to see how realistic your list is. Keep in mind\u00a0that any school on your list should be one where you see yourself succeeding and enjoying the next few years of your life.","excerpt":"As second semester seniors (a.k.a. #SSS), we have begun to reflect back on our high school experiences and look to pass along helpful advice and lessons we have learned.

It has all the elements that make a great science fiction show, so if you like science fiction, you will love 'Doctor Who'.\u201d\r\n\r\nHall said she started the club for fans of the show.\r\n\r\n\u201cI know that there are a lot of people at Paly who like 'Doctor Who',\" Hall said. \"After seeing the \"Harry Potter\" club on Club Day I thought it would be fun to start a club for all the 'Doctor Who' fans at Paly.\"\r\n\r\nHall said everyone, Doctor Who-fans and non-fans alike, is\u00a0welcome to join the club.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe plan to watch and discuss episodes, play 'Doctor Who'-related games and activities, and meet new people,\u201d Hall said. \u201cAnyone should come to the club who's\u00a0interested in 'Doctor Who.' You don't need to have seen every episode or know all the trivia. We just want to bring people together who love 'Doctor Who' and share that love with anyone who is new to the show.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe \"Doctor Who\" club meets in Room 218 at lunch on Fridays\r\n\r\n<strong>Science Everywhere Club<\/strong>\r\n\r\nLike science or technology?\r\n\r\nThe Science Everywhere Club promotes the learning of various fields of science according to club vice president\u00a0and junior Kevin Liu.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe started because we want to give Paly students opportunities to study the fields that they are interested in,\u201d Liu said. \u201cFor example, if people want to know how Tesla or hybrid cars work, we\u2019d watch or read articles about it.\u201d\r\n\r\nLiu and president junior Vineet Yellu started the club to learn about science that is not taught in the classroom.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe want to know about cool new technologies besides what we learned at school,\u201d Liu said. \u201cEspecially since we are living at Silicon Valley and there are so many resources here.\r\n\r\nLiu is looking\u00a0forward to running the club this semester.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m excited,\u201d Liu said. \u201cIt is a good opportunity to practice my leadership skills and do something for people who are interested in science.\u201d\r\n\r\nScience Everywhere Club meets Tuesdays at lunch in Room\u00a0<span style=\"color: #373e4d;\">1710.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<strong>Haven Club<\/strong>\r\n\r\nHaven is a\u00a0publication that\u00a0focuses on giving all Paly students a voice, according to senior and president Huda Navaid.\r\n\r\n\"Haven is a club as well as publication,\"<span style=\"color: #1e1e1e;\">\u00a0Navaid said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\"What we do is we try to take all the voices that can't be heard at Paly and bring them all together,\"Navaid said. \"People\u00a0can have a safe space to talk about the things they care about whether it is politics or things that are occurring around Paly.\"\r\n\r\nStudents interested in journalism or expressing their opinions to the Paly community should look into joining Haven, according to Navaid.\r\n\r\nHaven will meet Thursdays at lunch in Room 805.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_98640\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"401\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/haven.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-98640\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/haven.png\" alt=\"Haven is both a club and a publication and encourages open discussion about relative issues amongst the Paly community.

You do have a place and we can make this a better world whether standing up for someone being bullied or leading a march, it all matters. Sometimes in ways that we will never know because we never know who or how many people are watching us. Act as if the world is watching, because it is.\u201d\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Holman wants to create a communication channel between youth and the city.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere have been a bunch of meetings that have been organized to give youth a voice in the community and I encourage [youth] to seek them out,\u201d Holman said.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_99069\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/photo-1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-99069\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/photo-1.jpg\" alt=\"Former Palo Alto mayors and city council members listen to the address and with currently serving council members.

I like [Holman\u2019s stance on] stewardship, that\u2019s the way I see the city staff, this will be a better community, we don\u2019t want to be just a veneer.\u201d\r\n\r\nThroughout the address, Holman stated several data points to give a summary of the city's condition:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>$1.8 million is the median home value in the city<\/li>\r\n\t<li>54.8 percent of the homes in the city are occupied by the homeowners<\/li>\r\n\t<li>45.2 percent of homes in the city are occupied by renters<\/li>\r\n\t<li>148,209 is the population in Palo Alto, including residents at Stanford<\/li>\r\n\t<li>8271 square feet of parks, preserves, and open space in the city.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>836 bikers at Gunn High School, 805 at Palo Alto High School<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nHolman continued by outlining what she thought Palo Alto should be.\r\n\r\n\u201c[I want] Palo Alto to be the kind of town you want to live in, the kind of town that reflects your values, that makes you proud, that preserves your right to be heard, our open spaces and address traffic and housing issues, that supports diversity of business and residents that cares about and for those that are not as well of,\u201d Holman said.\r\n\r\nThe mayor\u00a0concluded by sharing her vision for the year.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have an inheritance that has been endowed upon us and it is up to us to care for it right now,\" Holman said.\u00a0\"Your [the resident's] voice still matters, use it this year so we can reconnect with each other.
