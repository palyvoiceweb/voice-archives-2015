Although there is some comfortable indoor seating, it's in the corners of the store, so outdoor seating seems to be a better option. There are still fun decorations up from the grand opening two months ago.\r\n\r\nTeaspoon has a large variety of fresh teas.

It was generally too watery and the pearls were gummy, but it had an excellent flavor. Photo by Alex Merkle-Raymond.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nOn to the pearl milk tea: the tea itself had\u00a0a very strong flavor, almost to a point of bitterness. I would recommend getting a fruity-flavored drink for the extra boost of sweetness, or maybe even going up to the full 100% sweetness option. The tea's consistency was watery, thin and not creamy. My drink was still quite warm because the ice hadn't cooled the drink enough, which is one of my biggest pet peeves.\r\n\r\nThe pearls, medium-sized and chewy, were a wonderful, sweet flavor that balanced out the strength of the tea.\u00a0The consistency was gummy, and tended to stick to the roof of my mouth when I chewed on them.\r\n\r\nThe most popular teas at Teaspoon are the cremas, rose and roasted tea, according to the store manager, Amy. There are many flavors that can be difficult to find at other places like white grape oolong, hojicha and roobios. The cremas are a tea base with an organic cream whipped topping. The most popular lactose-free tea option is the Grasshopper, a lychee green tea base mixed with fresh cucumber juice, according to their website.\r\n\r\n\"<span style=\"color: #141823;\">They actually have a good variety of tea flavors and many that I've never heard of.\u00a0I think the tea flavor in their drinks is richer, and they are always really consistent.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"color: #373e4d;\">Overall I prefer it to all the other PMT places around here even though it's a bit more expensive,\" senior Ken Chen said.<\/span>","excerpt":"Staff writer Alex Merkle-Raymond comes back to the ultimate pearl milk tea challenge.

Halas says Paly only narrowly won its last match against Los Altos.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re two equal teams, so this is basically to see who stays in the upper division,\u201d Halas said before the game. \u201cThis is basically our whole season right here.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Halas, Tuesday\u2019s match was delayed about an hour and a half because the Los Altos team originally went to Gunn High School instead of Paly and had to arrange for a bus to take them to the correct location. Halas says the Los Altos team mistakenly thought the construction of the new Paly Gym had already started and that all Paly home games were now at Gunn.\r\n\r\nBefore the match, the team organized a surprise Senior Night celebration for seniors Joseph Chang, Daniel Cohen-Wang, Alec Deng, Promise Lee, Matthew Li, Anthony Liu and Dan Su.
