While the bread was a bit hard, the sandwich had fresh ingredients and the avocado was appetizing. Both the turkey and cheese were flavorful, although the condiments were bland.

The pizza is split into eight slices, a bit too much for a single person serving.

Photo by MGM\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" \/><\/a> James Bond has returned within the new film, \"Spectre.\" Overall the film is satisfactory, but plot details take away from the action scenes and the story itself. Photo by MGM.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe James Bond franchise has returned with the thrilling new chapter to the Bond series, \"Spectre.\" The film continues the traditions from previous eras and as well as the story from recent Bond films while paving its own path, differentiating it from other Bond films. Its exciting sequences, iconic references and humorous script is sure to please both casual and die-hard Bond fans alike.\r\n\r\n\"Spectre,\" directed by Sam Mendes, begins with an opening sequence in Mexico City that rivals some of the best opening sequences in the series. The sequence follows Bond (Daniel Craig) tracking down a mysterious villain through the town square during the festive Day of the Dead celebrations. Bond then engages in a brilliantly shot helicopter fight scene which caps the action-packed opening scene. The rest of the movie follows Bond\u2019s quest to track down a person from his past and to take down the terrorist organization, Spectre.\r\n\r\nOne way \"Spectre\" succeeds is that it incorporates all the classic Bond moments that old fans will love. The introduction of \"Bond, James Bond?\" Check. Shaken, not stirred? Yup. The timeless Aston Martin? Of course. There are even many references to past films (\"From Russia With Love\" train scene, anyone?). However, where this film differs from the majority of the series is in its exploration of Bond\u2019s (Daniel Craig) past, a continuing theme from all of Craig\u2019s past Bond films.\r\n\r\nThough the exploration of Bond\u2019s past was done very well in Craig's previous movies (namely \"Casino Royale\" and \"Skyfall\"), in \"Spectre\" it distracts rather than adds to the plot. Extended monologues takes away from the action scenes and slows the pace of the movie. Also, the focus on Bond\u2019s past does not accentuate Bond\u2019s traditional mysterious and stoic nature and makes him much softer than previous films. It also leads to an unorthodox ending that combined with rumors of \"Spectre\" being Craig\u2019s final Bond film, fuels many rumors regarding the plot of the next film, \"Bond 25.\"\r\n\r\nDespite those issues, \"Spectre\" succeeds in many ways. Supporting characters Eve Moneypenny (Naomie Harris), Q (Ben Whishaw) and M (Ralph Fiennes) continue their strong performances from \"Skyfall.\" Harris plays a great sidekick to Bond while Whishaw does a phenomenal job adding funny moments and continuing to play an exceptional younger Q. Fiennes also does a good job taking over from the longtime Judie Dench as M, incorporating the steely attitude needed for the character. The script is well done, incorporating humor throughout while still retaining the darker feel regarding Bond's past. The cinematography is shot very well, as the action scenes were captivating and intense. The different locations Bond ventures into, such as Mexico City and Rome, are captured well by the directing, the clothing is classy and fashionable, and the explosions are bigger than ever.\r\n\r\nChristoph Waltz (Ernst Blofeld) plays a phenomenal antagonist. Waltz\u2019s idiosyncratic acting fits seamlessly with the role of \u201cOberhauser,\u201d but there is one problem \u2013 there was not enough of him. The first half of the film foreshadows Oberhauser to be an extremely powerful and invincible villain. However, when he is on-screen, he gives too many monologues and isn\u2019t able to have the same impact as past villains such as Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem) from \"Skyfall.\"\r\n\r\nDespite the divergence from the traditional Bond script, \"Spectre\" still retains the traditional Bond moments die-hard fans will look for, and its enthralling action scenes and humorous moments make it a must-watch even for the casual moviegoer.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"The James Bond franchise has returned with another hit film, \"Spectre.\" The film follows  Bond's attempt to track down a foe from his past and take down a terrorist organization.

In the game show, audience members\u00a0make deals with the show's host.\u00a0The host offers contestants something of value, such as cash, and contestants must choose whether to keep the object or trade it for a mystery item.\r\n\r\n\u201cMost of my friends and family were pretty shocked when they found out I was on the show, mostly because I hadn't mentioned it before,\u201d Mackris said. \u201cThe show taped in June, but I wasn't allowed to tell anyone that I was a contestant until the show aired.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the show, Mackris avoided purchasing a zonk; an object with little value to the buyer. She later turned down another unknown item, revealed to be a trip to the Caribbean island St. Lucia.\r\n\r\n\u201cI actually don't regret missing out on the trip to St. Lucia,\u201d Mackris said. \u201cIt would have been a cool experience but if I had won the trip I still probably would have traded it for the big deal of the day at the end of the show and would have ended up with the motorcycle anyway.\u201d\r\n\r\nFinally, she purchased a game room which she later traded for a \u201cbig deal\u201d mystery item.

Is it the powerful rule of the Greek gods or the tales of the humans that worship them? Do you remember grand stories of heroism about slaying horrendous monsters? In \u201cThe Odyssey,\u201d the Palo Alto High School Theater Department aims to bring the world of ancient Greece back to life and showcases the long journey of Odysseus on his return home from the Trojan War. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of the play, written by playwright Mary Zimmerman, chronicles the enormous amount of obstacles Odysseus (senior Ophir Sneh) faces during his journey, including an angry cyclops, enchanting sirens, vindictive gods and rowdy lords. However, the difficulties endure after his return, as Odysseus must fight to restore the life he had before the war. Along the way, the goddess Athena (senior Sophie Swezey), Odysseus' son, Telemachus (junior Jackson Kienitz) and other characters help Odysseus. His grieving wife Penelope (senior Molly Kraus) fights off suitors who wish to marry her since her husband Odysseus is presumed dead. Though it is usually clear what is going on, the short modern-day element at the beginning of the play is slightly confusing and seems irrelevant to the rest of the plot.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The cast members do a great job of capturing the essence of their characters. The dialogue is understandable, and the story is portrayed nicely whether it is a lighthearted, fun moment or a serious scene. Odysseus, with his sincerity and determination, is convincing in his image of a hero, and is nicely balanced by the loud and foolish actions of rowdy nobles (senior Matthew O\u2019Reilly, junior Jason Pollak and senior Daniel Cottrell). A\u00a0silent muse shows\u00a0the audience, through body movements, the transferring of ideas from gods to mortals in a fluid, creative manner.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The show features one main set with a backdrop of waves, clouds and rocks. Throughout the play, the location and time period is projected onto the stage to help clarify the plot. Greek columns are cleverly lifted on and off stage depending on the scene, and a platform in the back showcases the presence of the Olympic gods. The huge puppet used to create the character of the cyclops is a particularly impressive prop, and adds a dramatic feel to an action-packed scene. The presence of a boat is smartly substituted by artfully arranged chairs, convincing pole movements to represent rowing and characters that sway to the drift of the faux ocean. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The characters\u2019 costumes showcased great attention to detail, with a modern twist on some of the garments and accessories such as necklaces and headpieces. Although the torn tunics, leggings and pants of some of the characters were simple, they seemed authentic to their station. The goddesses had interesting, flowing dress variations and the make-up on the nymph Calypso (junior Nadia Leinhos) is particularly beautiful. In instances when characters were \u201cdisguised,\u201d clever costume switches that do not disguise the actual identity of the character are utilized.<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_111537\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/unnamed.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-111537\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/unnamed.jpg\" alt=\"Calypso (junior Nadia Leinhos) holds Odysseus captive on her island, rendering him unable to return home to Ithaca.

Recorded music, <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/10\/06\/alumnus-composes-music-for-fall-production\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">composed by alumnus Jonathan Shue<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as well as live music provided by student musicians junior Edward Park and junior Laura Sieh, accompanies the actors during almost every scene with an assortment of instruments such as bajo sexto, drums and wind chimes. The calm and melodic music makes watching it much more entertaining and helps to fully immerse the audience into ancient Greece. Interesting and artistic use of scarves and chairs as props during dance sequences made scene changes flow smoothly and helped set the tone for the next scene. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An epic saga that includes elements of adventure, romance and tragedy, \u201cThe Odyssey\u201d is a production that does justice to Homer\u2019s classic poem. It will please the eyes and ears of theater-goers of almost any age, though small children might get restless with\u00a0the two hours and 30 minutes running length. Although the first act seems to move a little slowly, the second act picks up momentum and carries it to the end, providing for a satisfying conclusion.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe Odyssey\u201d has four more showings on Nov. 7, Nov. 8, Nov. 12 and Nov. 13.

Allow your eyes to close.\" This is how Christopher Farina's Advanced Placement psychology students begin their class each day.\r\n\r\nThe students perform mindful meditation, a popular form of relaxation in which participants focus on their thoughts, feelings, sounds or breath by sitting in silence with their eyes closed.\u00a0This method does not require any spiritual belief, but rather, it gives individuals an opportunity to shut out unnecessary thoughts to facilitate a deeper connection with themselves.\u00a0Meditational practice, which stems from an ancient Buddhist relaxation practice, has become increasingly popular\u00a0in Western culture in recent years, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/blog\/meditation-modern-life\/201307\/overview-meditation-its-origins-and-traditions\" target=\"_blank\">Psychology Today<\/a>.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/life.gaiam.com\/article\/meditation-101-techniques-benefits-beginner-s-how\" target=\"_blank\">Studies<\/a> show that a\u00a0few minutes of this mindful meditation\u00a0each\u00a0day can lead to\u00a0emotional benefits that mirror the benefits of physical activity.\r\n\r\nPalo Alto High School should systematically implement meditation into the beginning of certain\u00a0class periods per week to reduce stress, foster\u00a0a healthy class\u00a0environment and encourage high levels of focus.\r\n\r\nOn a typical school day, most teachers are unable to give their students time to exercise or participate in stress-relieving\u00a0activities. With that, students are expected to sit for six hours each day, with an occasional break, while simultaneously maintaining a healthy well being.\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This causes stress that often weighs down students, and it is essential to\u00a0find an effective\u00a0method to alleviate\u00a0it. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To their credit, Paly administrators have focused on finding\u00a0ways to reduce\u00a0Paly's\u00a0high-stress culture in the past years.\u00a0One of their solutions\u00a0included\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/04\/29\/paly-teachers-incorporate-meditation-into-the-classroom\/\" target=\"_blank\">introducing meditation<\/a>\u00a0into classrooms. By the end of the year, however, most teachers did not continue the practice, aside from a select few.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Josh Bloom, astronomy teacher and Teacher on Special Assignment for social and emotional learning, is one of the few faculty members who introduces students to meditational practices\u00a0each year. According to Bloom, he began the\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mindful practice five years ago to sort out the stress in his own life. After\u00a0Bloom found the results to be\u00a0beneficial,\u00a0he decided to share the practice\u00a0with his students.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pressure on kids in this community around this idea of success, what success means, and what's required for success,\u201d\u00a0Bloom said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Introducing just five minutes of meditation at the beginning of each class\u00a0at Paly could be the beginning of a solution to this problem.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meditation has been shown to reduce\u00a0feelings of anxiety, increase calmness and enable people to enjoy their lives to a fuller and happier extent.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For students, meditation is a chance to control\u00a0one's own\u00a0mind\u00a0and live in the present moment, providing an opportunity to pause during\u00a0a hectic\u00a0day, according to the website, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tipsonlifeandlove.com\/self-help\/meditating-your-way-to-greater-happiness-and-health-in-20-minutes-a-day\" target=\"_blank\">Love &amp;\u00a0Life<\/a>.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cThe mindfulness of this experience is creating space for you to focus on what's going on inside of you,\u201d Bloom says. \u201cTo allow yourself to step back and become aware of your thoughts, and how you're thinking.\u201d\r\n\r\nMeditation is also a way to focus attention and eliminate the stream of thoughts crowding your mind. Students who meditate during class time will find themselves retaining information better after\u00a0refueling. They will be able to work harder with more energy, and therefore succeed more in their classes.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The practice of meditation also\u00a0benefits students physically.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meditation enables an inner quiet and peace in people, which has been scientifically proven to slow the heart rate, lower blood pressure and decrease the production of stress hormones. Just five minutes a day of this practice grows the areas of the brain associated with memory, empathy and sense of self, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.medicaldaily.com\/mental-health-benefits-meditation-itll-alter-your-brains-grey-matter-and-improve-319298\" target=\"_blank\">Medical Daily<\/a>,\u00a0a website dedicated to sharing studies on\u00a0mental health.<\/span>\r\n\r\nStudents could begin to earn these physical and emotional benefits if teachers of one required course introduce meditation into their classes. Therefore, students would be given a chance to experience the practice two or three times per week, which is enough time to receive healthy benefits\u00a0through just a brief five minutes a day.\r\n\r\nThis would require commitment from the\u00a0department, and a<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lthough some might argue\u00a0that these\u00a0practices would waste valuable class time, one should keep in mind that it takes less than five minutes at the beginning of a class period, providing benefits that outweigh the small amount of time used for meditation.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">English teacher George Vuong, who has introduced\u00a0meditation to students after learning about the method at the end of last\u00a0year, advocates for other teachers to introduce it as well.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThis is a good beginning of a class period to kind of help things get settled down and make a more calm environment,\u201d Vuong said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meditation\u00a0creates many more focused, relaxed and de-stressed students, allowing students to\u00a0put in more\u00a0effort, interest and their attention into the period's\u00a0classwork.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\"[Through meditation] y<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ou begin to discover the aspects of ourselves that are common to all human beings,\" said Bloom. \"The more you come to know and understand that part of our human being, the more we begin to understand that part being in all of us.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\nWho knew that a simple five minute task every few\u00a0days could so significantly impact our lives?","excerpt":"Staff writer Morgan Keller shares her opinion on implementing meditational practices into the beginning of class periods.","date":"2015-11-07 09:53:30","author":"Morgan Keller","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/abcd1.jpg","categories":["Opinion","Spotlight"],"tags":["meditation","opinion","paly"]}]
