Palo Alto is slightly cooler than other areas in the state, but the water supply is a finite resource. It's like a fish tank: if it\u2019s being used in one place, it is not in another.\u201d\r\n\r\n\"I think it's a really good idea to restrict water,\" freshman Rebecca Yao said. \"I try to take shorter showers and we recently changed our lawn into desert plants last summer. People don't really use their lawns and the desert plants look really nice and make people aware \u00a0of the issue. My friend has a sign that says 'brown is the new green.'\"\r\n\r\nViolations will follow a tiered structure, with repeat offenses having larger consequences, according to the<a href=\"www.cityofpaloalto.org\/water\"> city\u2019s website.<\/a>\r\n\r\n1st violation: Doorhanger\/Email\/Phone call to customer\r\n\r\n2nd violation: Doorhanger\/Email\/Phone call to customer\r\n\r\n3rd violation: Certified letter from the Utility Director notifying customer of violation and potential future fines\r\n\r\n5th violation: Flow restrictors may be installed\r\n\r\nViolations will be enforced through community efforts.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re planning on bringing a couple more water waste coordinators on board to help with regulation,\u201d Elvert said. \"But it will largely be based on customers contacting us with [their own reports] through the PA 311 app. We\u2019ll go out to reported sites and check in with the neighbors and [home owner].\u201d\r\n\r\nThe city has posted several suggestions on how residents can cut down on water usage today on its\u00a0<a href=\"www.cityofpaloalto.org\/water\">website<\/a>.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe most important message is that, we [Palo Alto Utilities] are here to help,\u201d Elvert said. \u201cWe have free services, including surveys, tips, rebates, and we can provide assistance.\u201d","excerpt":"In response to California\u2019s drought and statewide water goals, the City of Palo Alto is taking initiative to cut its water use by enacting water restrictions that will affect all citizens starting on June 1.","date":"2015-05-28 13:42:17","author":"Will Zhou","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/photo-21.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"34100":"city","29490":"drought","8939":"palo alto","44908":"sprinkler","44909":"turf","44907":"water restriction"}},{"id":105213,"title":"Alisha Kumar&#8217;s travel blog: By the Breeze","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/05\/28\/alisha-kumars-travel-blog-by-the-breeze\/","content":"&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/Alisha-11.jpeg\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-105215\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/Alisha-11.jpeg\" alt=\"Alisha (1)\" width=\"707\" height=\"527\" \/><\/a>Travel and Lifestyle blogger, junior Alisha Kumar is the author of<a href=\"http:\/\/bythebreezeblog.com\/\">\u00a0By the Breeze<\/a>,\u00a0a blog featuring stories on travel and food.
