ASB would like to emphasize that this winter dance, like all of our events, is<i> all-inclusive<\/i>. Students of every gender identity and sexual orientation are empowered to ask (or not ask) any person they so desire to this event. We encourage and welcome all students to attend, whether they choose do so with a date, with friends or alone.\"\r\n\r\nThe theme was decided after joint input from an online poll sent out to the student body last month and extensive discussion within ASB. The poll granted students the ability to voice their opinion on the theme for the upcoming dance and garnered just under 300 responses, the vast majority of which indicated for a Sadie Hawkins theme, according to Senior Class President Claire Liu.\r\n\r\nLiu expands on how ASB has worked to address stereotypes of boy-ask-girl dances and Sadie's dances.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #373e4d;\">\"ASB officers are well aware of some of the conversation points Sadie's as a concept brings up, and we felt this would also be an appropriate time to address some of the gender roles and traditional notions the dance may be associated with,\" Liu said. \"We really saw this as an opportunity to expand the meaning of Sadie's, and make efforts to redefine it and make it more inclusive, as shown in our publicity, event page, and press statement.\"\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\nAs part of ASB, Senior Class Vice President Olivia Scola is involved in organizing the dance.\r\n\r\n\"I am anticipating that the winter dance will be successful,\" Scola said. \"I think that girls have the opportunity to ask anyone they want to any dance we have, but Sadie's encourages women to ask their friend or special someone even more.\"\r\n\r\nSophomore Katie Passarello asked a date to join her at the dance.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #373e4d;\">\"A bunch of my friends and I decided to ask our guy friends in a group because it would be cute and fun,\" Passarello said. \"I'm a good dancer, so I can't wait to show off my moves.\"\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\nThe dance will be three hours long, from 7:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. Additionally, ASB is offering free donuts to all attendees.\r\n\r\nTickets will be sold on the Quad during lunch, on the <a href=\"https:\/\/palywebstore.myschoolcentral.com\/asbworks\/(S(5qpc0a45pntd5r45otkkil3m))\/WebStore.aspx\">online web store<\/a>\u00a0and at the door\u00a0according to ASB.

Gong Cha has come to downtown Palo Alto to give you a little more variety in your pearl milk tea endeavors. Panda Milk tea with crunchy white pearls and chewy tapioca pearls and QQ Passion Fruit green tea with vibrant fruity flavors that taste like summer are just a couple of creative flavors that Gong Cha offers.\r\n\r\nGong Cha, which opened last Saturday, is located at 439 Waverley St. and has other locations in the Bay Area, including Fremont and San Jose. It\u00a0also has more than 300 stores in Asia and Australia, according to its\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/gong-cha-usa.com\/about-us\/\">website<\/a>.\r\n\r\nThere are many ways for a customer to personalize a drink at Gong Cha. The sweetness and ice levels can be adjusted, and there are a variety of additions, such as the standard egg pudding, tapioca pearls, coconut jelly and herbal jelly. Gong Cha also features milk foam, basil seed, ai-yu jelly and the uncommon white pearls. The white pearls are made from seaweed extract and are slightly crunchier and healthier for you, according to shift lead Jacki Wasmann.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_98965\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/IMG_5931.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-98965\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/IMG_5931.jpg\" alt=\"An array of possible additions is on display at Gong Cha currently.

According to\u00a0Wasmann, the green and black pearl milk teas are the best sellers.\r\n\r\nGong Cha is the second pearl milk tea\u00a0place in Palo Alto after <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/10\/29\/pearl-milk-tea-comes-to-palo-alto-from-taiwans-t4\/\">T4<\/a> moved in last\u00a0October. Wasmann said that the company is not worried about the competition with T4\u00a0since it has\u00a0different specialties and everyone has different preferences.\r\n\r\nPalo Alto High School students are excited about the new PMT store since they are no longer limited to T4\u00a0in the local vicinity.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #373e4d;\">\"<\/span>The tea itself was really fresh,\" junior Aiva Petriceks said. \"Unlike other stores where you can mostly taste the syrup, the tea actually came through. The passion fruit tea was amazing. I didn't like the boba [tapioca\u00a0pearls] because it wasn't as soft as I would like it.

The interior is very dark with the color scheme focusing on brown. There was limited seating, but there were still places where you could sit down and chat.\r\n\r\nGong Cha has two sizes: medium and large. The drinks are very customizable with variations in ice and sugar. The sweetness is very important to change because the tea is generally very sweet.\r\n\r\nThe tapioca pearls definitely left something to be desired. The pearls were not squishy,\u00a0felt very oblong and were very difficult to fit through the straw. The center felt almost undercooked.\r\n\r\nThe tea itself was very flavorful and rich. The texture was creamy and not at all chunky or powdery. There was no distinct feature for Gong Cha. It felt very standard, where nothing was bad but nothing was striking or extremely delicious.\r\n\r\nThe service was very slow. The workers talked\u00a0with each other to make sure they were doing the right thing. I assume this is because the store is still very new and they have not worked out all the kinks yet. The staff was very friendly and willing to answer any questions about the menu. Gong Cha uses a stamping system where the 10th drink is free.\r\n\r\nGong Cha is currently open from 11:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"Gong Cha, a new Pearl Milk Tea shop, opened up in Palo Alto on Saturday at 439 Waverley Street.

The crime rate in Palo Alto is lower\u00a0than that of 80 percent of the cities in California, which gives Palo Alto an \u201cA+\u201d rating in the\u00a0AreaVibes\u00a0system. However, AreaVibes rates cities in comparison to each other, and despite acing the AreaVibes test, Palo Alto still isn\u2019t\u00a0perfect according to more local statistics.\r\n\r\nAccording to the City of Palo Alto website, there were a total of 332 burglaries in Palo Alto in 2012 and 242 burglaries in 2013. The chance of being a victim of a property crime, or burglary, in Palo Alto is 1 in 46, and precautions should still be taken.\r\n\r\nThe Paly Voice interviewed Lt. Perron of the Palo Alto Police Department to compile five tips for students to protect themselves against burglary, whether they\u2019re heading to practice or home alone for the weekend.\r\n\r\nListed below are five of Perron's tips to avoid a burglary:\r\n\r\n<b>1. Leave everything locked:<\/b>\r\n\r\nAlways lock your windows and doors. According to Perron, sometimes people leave doors unlocked because they assume Palo Alto is a safe community.\r\n\r\n\u201cNever leave a door or window open or unlocked,\u201d Perron wrote in an email interview. \u201cNo matter how hot it may be or how short of a time you may be gone.\" Perron said that the most common points of entry are often just \u201cdoors that people will leave unlocked or open, either intentionally, because they have a false sense of security living in a safe city like Palo Alto, or accidentally.\"\r\n\r\n<b>2. Pretend you are home:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPerron suggests turning on some music or the TV before leaving the house or leaving the lights on so that the potential burglar thinks someone is home.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey [the burglars] are looking for empty homes so they can break in, steal stuff real fast, and leave quickly with no chances of getting caught,\u201d Perron said.\r\n\r\n<b>3. Use just one headphone:<\/b>\r\n\r\nWhen home alone, avoid studying while listening to music with headphones on, as you might not hear\u00a0suspicious noises.\r\n\r\n<b>4. Beware the solicitor ruse:<\/b>\r\n\r\nThe most common trick burglars use when trying to find out if someone is home is pretending to be a solicitor, according to Perron. Even if you don\u2019t want to answer the door, talk to them through the door so they know someone\u2019s home.\r\n\r\n\u201cBurglars don\u2019t want confrontations, and they don\u2019t want witnesses,\u201d Perron said. Just knowing that someone is in the house is often enough of a deterrent for them.\r\n\r\n<b>5. Look out for your neighbors:<\/b>\r\n\r\nIf you see an unfamiliar car drive aimlessly down your street, or a stranger ring the doorbell of a neighbor\u2019s house and then walk around to the back, call the police. Chances are these are experienced burglars who are working their way through a neighborhood and may target your house next.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to learn more or have any questions, the Palo Alto Police Department has a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cityofpaloalto.org\/gov\/depts\/pol\/social_media_connections.asp\">media presence<\/a> on Twitter, Facebook, Nextdoor, Nixle, YouTube, Flickr and will be launching an Instagram later this year.

In this second installment of a three-part series, The Paly Voice features the youngest and least-experienced members of the Palo Alto High School varsity basketball teams: the freshmen.<\/em>\r\n\r\nRecently, The Paly Voice sat down with one of the two freshmen on this year's girls' basketball team, forward Sophie Frick, to talk about life at Paly, inspirational teammates and what it will take for the girls' team to finish strong.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_98904\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"616\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/IMG_8696.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-98904\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/IMG_8696.jpg\" alt=\"Freshman forward Sophie Frick warms up behind the three-point line prior to a game vs. Gunn earlier this season.

Frick is one of two freshman on the girls' team this season. Photo by George Lu.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Paly Voice: It's a unique situation to play varsity basketball as a freshman. What's it like for you?\r\n\r\nSophie Frick: It's a really, really special experience, especially getting to play with the older players. You get to learn a ton from the upperclassmen, and even though there's not that many, the people that are older than me and Carly [Leong], we get to learn a lot from them.\r\n\r\nTPV: Speaking of the older players, out of all the other players on the team, who do you look up to most? Personality-wise and playing-wise?\r\n\r\nSF: I would pick Coco Lovely because she's a beast out there on the court, diving after every loose ball and looking for every drive and every rebound. Overall, she's such a happy person and always really positive \u2013 something I aspire to be like.\r\n\r\nTPV: What do you like about Coach Scott Peters as a mentor?\r\n\r\nSF: Coach Scott is very passionate about the game. You will not meet anybody who loves the game more than him and cares about all of us and the team more. He'll get us pizza after practice because we did well, and he teaches us stuff that I would not learn from any other coach.\r\n\r\nTPV: What do you like most about the high school experience thus far?\r\n\r\nSF: I honestly really like the different people and the overall environment and atmosphere at Paly. There's a lot of really positive people, teachers, staff and upperclassmen. New friends are great, as well.\r\n\r\nTPV: All right. What's the worst thing about the transition to high school?\r\n\r\nSF: I would probably say getting used to scheduling and time management. But I am learning and getting used to it.\r\n\r\nTPV: What's your individual goal for the rest of the season? What do you think about this team's potential? What does a team that has started so strong have to do to finish strong?\r\n\r\nSF: Our stretch goal is to win CCS [Central Coast Section],\u00a0without a doubt. My personal goal would be to continue to improve as a team player and pass to teammates that are open. Small things like that. We all want to finish strong.\r\n\r\nTPV: Is there an athlete in professional sports who you look up to? Kind of like Lovely, but someone more well known?\r\n\r\nSF: I don't think there's a particular athlete. I think it's more like a team play, like the San Francisco 49ers, even though they didn't do very well this year. In past years, however, their defense really works together and makes plays as a team.\r\n\r\nTPV: What does it mean to you to have Carly [Leong] on the team with you, as a fellow freshman going through the same experience?\r\n\r\nSF: Carly's like my No. 1 on the team.

It took a lot of pressure off [of me].\u201d\r\n\r\nKnodt, a member of\u00a0the Massialas Fencing Foundation in San Francisco, attributed his win to multiple factors.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's a combination of a lot of things,\u201d Knodt said. \u201cI guess the most noticeable things I could point to would be good coaches, lots of experience in past tournaments and practice. I try not to think about how things will end up. I just try to fence and worry about the end result after it's all over.\u201d\r\n\r\nKnodt also emphasized that despite this achievement, he remains future-focused.\r\n\r\n\u201cBefore this tournament, I qualified for international Under 16 events,\u201d Knodt said. \u201cWith this result, I hopefully can qualify for Under 19 international events. \u2026 I'm just going to keep practicing and try to improve my fencing.\"\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"Multiple Palo Alto High School students won gold medals for fencing at the Junior Olympics last weekend in Virginia.","date":"2015-02-18 22:43:12","author":"Wesley Woo","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/fencing.jpg","categories":["Sports"],"tags":{"14171":"fencing","38970":"gold","38971":"gold medal","38968":"julian knodt","38969":"junior olympics","8944":"palo alto high school","9052":"royce wang"}},{"id":98999,"title":"Slideshow: Boys&#8217; soccer finish first in league on Senior Night","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/02\/18\/slideshow-boys-soccer-finish-first-in-league-on-senior-night\/","content":"Palo Alto High School boys' soccer (12-3-3, 8-2-1) celebrated its Senior Night and last game in league play by defeating Los Gatos High School (9-8-3, 3-5-3) 2-1 to finish in first place in the De Anza League.\r\n\r\nThe team's five seniors were honored in a ceremony before the game.\r\n\r\nJunior midfielder Cole Tierney scored both of Paly's goals, securing the team's win.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"\/\/www.cincopa.com\/media-platform\/iframe.aspx?fid=AMGAnWsDkkBB\" width=\"600\" height=\"430\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"Palo Alto High School boys' soccer (12-3-3, 8-2-1) celebrated its Senior Night by defeating Los Gatos High School (9-8-3, 3-5-3) 2-1 to finish first place in the De Anza League.\r\n","date":"2015-02-18 21:09:43","author":"Amy Leung","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/IMG_1132.jpg","categories":["Uncategorized"],"tags":{"10311":"boys soccer","17499":"FIRST","9884":"league","9914":"los gatos","9087":"Senior Night","10981":"win"}},{"id":99025,"title":"Naviance demonstration for students during Tutorial Feb. 24 in LRC, parent demo at 7 p.m. March 4","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/02\/18\/naviance-demonstration-for-students-tutorial-feb-24-in-lrc-parent-demo-at-7-p-m-march-4\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2015-02-18 18:04:06","author":"Lizzie Chun","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":{"38974":"demo","38973":"demonstration","38972":"naviance"}}]
