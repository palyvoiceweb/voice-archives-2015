According to Swezey, each underclassman talks about their senior anonymously until finally revealing their identity at the end.\n\nAs the night went on, Paly theater teacher Kathleen Woods gave awards and a different theater-related book to each senior.\n\nThis tradition has been going on in the theater department for many years, according to Woods.\n\n\u201cI love it [this tradition] and I will keep continuing it,\u201d Woods said. \u201cSome of the awards I give are traditional awards, some are named after famous people, and some of them are new. I just try to reflect a little bit on the journey I\u2019ve had with the seniors the past one to four years.
