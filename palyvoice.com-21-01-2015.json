A selection committee later reviews the applicants and selects based on strict criteria.\r\n\r\n\u201cI went to Sacramento and had lunch with the superintendent [of the state], Tom Torlakson, the other finalists and people who worked at the Department of Education to talk about issues at public schools and the changes we can make,\u201d Liu said.\r\n\r\nDuring her visit, Liu learned about the passions of the other finalists.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was so humbled to be selected with three incredible intelligent and conscious young men,\u201d Liu said. \u201cDahkota Brown [Argonaut High School] works on an Native American issues, Benjamin Beltran [Nevada Union High School] works on the achievement gap and Dustin Chiang [Mission San Jose High School] is the two-term president of the California Distributive Education Clubs of America.

The interview is the only opportunity for applicants to meet with college representatives in person. Photo by Hannah Nguyen.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe applications are in. The big\u00a0January deadlines have lapsed and the Class of 2015 is beginning to bask in the glory of Second-Semester-Seniority. The burdens of The Common Application, supplements, test scores and recommendations have been lifted. Time to break out the whiffle balls and put this whole \u201ccollege thing\u201d behind us, right? Well, sort of. One more key component of the application still looms ahead for many seniors: The interview.\r\n\r\nWhile it might not make or break your application, the interview is the only opportunity applicants have to meet with a representative of a college,\u00a0one-on-one, face-to-face. Forget the test scores, forget the grades. This is your chance to show your college, in person, who you really are, and what kind of student you will be. How easily do you talk to strangers? What gets \u00a0you excited? What sense of humor do you have? These are the qualities that can't be organized in lists on the Common App. At the end of the day, the only part of your application that you take with you to college is, well, you.\r\n\r\nAfter having been through the college interview process\u00a0twice\u00a0myself, and consulting peers and a Columbia University alumni who has conducted interviews in the past, I have picked up a few pointers on how to walk away from an interview feeling successful. Here are some tips on preparing for your interview, and what you can do to make your interview worthwhile.\r\n\r\n<strong>Before Your Interview:<\/strong>\r\n\r\n1. Get in contact.\r\n\r\nThe process of setting up an interview is different across schools. Some schools give your contact information to alumni, who will then get in touch with you about an interview. Other schools will provide contact information of a nearby alum, and expect you to take the initiative of setting up an interview time. Do this as soon as possible to give them the most flexibility about a time to meet with you. Give them different times that you are available, and emphasize that you can work with their schedule. Exchange phone numbers, so they have an easy way to contact you on the day of the interview.\r\n\r\n2. Do your research.\r\n\r\nYou can almost guarantee that your interviewer will ask something to the extent of \u201cWhy _____?\u201d Prepare your answer, and be sure to know which specific qualities of the school you can talk about for a good amount of time\u00a0\u2013\u00a0don\u2019t be afraid to make it personal. Do they have an award-winning marching band that you\u2019d love to join? Is it a particular study abroad program that attracts you? Do you just love to be surrounded in nature? Understand why that particular school is good for you goals and interests, and what it is about you that makes you a good fit. Have ideas in your head, but avoid reciting your answer word for word beforehand. There\u2019s a difference between sounding prepared and sounding scripted.\r\n\r\n3. Ask your own questions.\r\n\r\nYour interviewer will also serve as a resource to learn more about the school.\u00a0Use this as an opportunity to show interest and preparedness by asking specific questions about programs and activities. Don\u2019t waste time by asking things that can be found on the website, like how many clubs the school has. Ask instead why 60 percent of the students are involved Greek life and how that impacts campus culture.\r\n\r\n<strong>On the Day Of Your Interview:<\/strong>\r\n\r\n1. Bring a R\u00e9sum\u00e9.\r\n\r\nA must-have if they ask for one, a bonus if they don\u2019t. An well-organized r\u00e9sum\u00e9 says that you are\u00a0prepared and professional. Use your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to summarize the skills and experiences that you think are most important, including but not limited to work experience, community servic or athletic achievement. Not only will a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 give your interview talking points during the interview, but it will also help them remember you later, when they are writing up your evaluation.\r\n\r\n2. Dress appropriately.\r\n\r\nSelf-explanatory. You want them to imagine you as a student on their campus, so dress modestly, and go for a little formality. You're more likely to leave a good impression and show that you value your time with the interviewer if you look polished and presentable. Definitely leave the sweats and tanks at home. If you're the superstitious type, it probably wouldn't hurt to wear something with the school's color.\r\n\r\n3. Bring sustenance.\r\n\r\nIf you are at a caf\u00e9, the nice interviewers will ask if you would like to get something to drink before you start your interview. Saying yes will not make you annoying, it will make you human. Come prepared with a water bottle just in case. Talking for 20 straight minutes will inevitably make you thirsty, and having something to drink could be a game-changer in how articulately you deliver your answers. The interviewer will think nothing less of you if you need to take a sip of water between questions.\r\n\r\n4. Be punctual.\r\n\r\nIf you make your interviewer wait extended amounts of time for you, there\u2019s very little you can say to convince them that you are responsible, organized or deserving of a place at their school. Plan ahead, and if you\u2019re meeting in a public place like a caf\u00e9, arrive before them to secure a table. Shoot them a text to let them know where you are and what color you are wearing, so they don\u2019t have to search the room to determine which 18-year-old is their interviewee.\r\n\r\n5. Relax. You are not on trial.\r\n\r\nTake your time to understand each question, and figure out the best way to answer it. Think about what you are going to say before you say it, so you don\u2019t end up blurting out a nonsensical string of \u201clike's\u201d and \"um's.\" Avoid\u00a0simple \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d responses to keep it conversational.\r\n\r\n6. Be Yourself.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, your college interviewer isn\u2019t trying to grill you or intimidate you. They are trying to understand what kind of person you are, and if you are a good fit for their school. Speak passionately about the things that are important to you, and answer honestly about how you have confronted challenges in your life. Say what you truly think, not what you think they want to hear.\r\n\r\n7. Anything else?\r\n\r\nThere will come a point in the interview when the rep will ask if there's anything else that the college should know about you.\u00a0Don't be shy about this one. You have spent the last 18 or so years of your life doing and thinking things that make you a unique person, and colleges should know why it is you are who you are. Reiterate the points you have already discussed if you deem them significant qualities, and add in anything else about you that is pertinent that hasn't come up yet. Maybe it's that you have a baby sister who has taught you the duties of responsibility. Maybe it's a charming anecdote about an embarrassing moment that taught you a lesson in humility. Maybe it's a statement about how despite all of the strong applications they are receiving, you are the best candidate there is because nobody else in the world can do exactly what you do. Leave them with something to remember.\r\n\r\n<strong>After the interview:<\/strong>\r\n\r\nShow your gratitude.\r\n\r\nBe sure to thank your interviewer after your interview is complete. It probably wouldn\u2019t hurt to send an email as well, to thank them for their time.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"Your applications may be in, but there's one more missing piece.

Photo: Claire Eberhart and Teddie Stewart.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nPalo Alto High School sophomores Teddie Stewart and Claire Eberhart are putting on the event, entitled \"Point B: Teen Poetry Jam,\" where teens can come to listen to or perform poetry with no admission cost.\r\n\r\n\"Come share and listen to poetry at the Teen Arts Council's first Poetry Jam!\" the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/789655184409227\/?ref_dashboard_filter=upcoming\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook page<\/a> states. \"This nonjudgmental environment is the perfect place for anyone that's a verse novice to a poetry expert.\"\r\n\r\nEberhart and Stewart are hoping to create a \"laid-back, mellow climate\" for the Poetry Jam to encourage a mood of \"acceptance and general happiness,\" according to Eberhart. There will be a mic, mood lighting, beanbag chairs and a caf\u00e9 type feel, with coffee, hot chocolate and baked goods for sale.\r\n\r\nThose interested in performing a poem should contact Eberhart or Stewart at teenartscouncil@gmail.com or message them on Facebook and include their name and title of poem if available. There will also be poems provided at the event for anyone who wants to read them. Any type of poetry is welcome, and poems do not have to be memorized.\r\n\r\n\"There are almost no restrictions for the types of poems that can be performed,\" Eberhart said. \"I\u00a0hope for a wide range of classic, published poems by poetry sages to inspiring, original poems by the students of the Bay Area \u2013 anything from haikus to free verse to odes.\"\r\n\r\nThe idea for the event came about when Eberhart and Stewart, who are both passionate about poetry, noticed an absence of a place to express and share a love for poetry.\r\n\r\n\"I've been faced with several people who share the same kind of love for poems that I do,\" Eberhart said. \"I strongly believe that teenagers have the most creative minds and write beautifully, but are often discouraged by the mindset that it's kinda dorky. And for some reason, there had been no real medium besides the paper or the online publisher for sharing poetry. Besides standing idly by, I decided to take action and really make it happen.\"\r\n\r\nThe title of the event, \"Point B: Teen Poetry Jam,\" has special meaning to both Eberhart and Stewart.\r\n\r\n\"Point B is Claire's and my favorite poem by Sarah Kay, who writes slam poetry,\" Stewart said. \"And it's where we connected and found our shared love of poetry. It also means that our poetry jam will hopefully be people's Point B, or a place that they can always go to without hesitation. It's another way of us promoting our idea of a family of poetry lovers, new and old.\"\r\n\r\nEberhart and Stewart hope that there will be many more poetry jams in the future.\r\n\r\n\"We hope to continue Point B throughout our high school years,\" Stewart said. \"And we also hope to host four events a year, kind of like a seasonal thing: one in summer, one in fall, one in winter and one in spring.\"","excerpt":"Teen Arts Council's first Poetry Jam will be held from 7 to 9 p.m. this Friday, Jan. 16, at the Palo Alto Children's Theater.

There will also be a variety of food stations with tables available to eat at.\r\n\r\n\"I think it will be a really nice location for Prom because it's in the city,\" senior Christine Langston said. \"It looks really pretty on the outside. The pictures online of the inside look elegant, fancy and like an actual ballroom, which will be a more traditional setting compared to last year's.\"\r\n\r\nThe San Francisco City Hall was rebuilt after the 1906 earthquake and is modeled after the Dome des Invalides in Paris where Napoleon's tomb is located.\r\n\r\nProm will be held on April 18 and buses will transport students to and from the event. The theme of Prom will be announced at the Winter Dance on Feb. 20, according to Ben-Efraim.","excerpt":"At the Student vs. Staff Basketball game at brunch Thursday, the Palo Alto High School Prom location for 2015 was announced by the Associated Student Body to be held at the San Francisco City Hall.","date":"2015-01-15 13:44:49","author":"Maddy Jones","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/10931011_907653035920069_8507970456468805690_n.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":{"9016":"prom","36408":"prom 2015","36409":"prom location"}}]
