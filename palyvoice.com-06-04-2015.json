Photo by Dhara Yu.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nChemistry teacher Silja Paymer, who conducted the demonstration, received superficial first- and second-degree burns but\u00a0was\u00a0released from an emergency\u00a0burn unit shortly after being transported to the hospital. She told The Paly Voice in an email last evening that\u00a0she is now resting at home and will return to teaching after spring break.\r\n\r\nAccording to witness sophomore Jessica Wong, an explosion occurred during 3rd Period while Paymer\u00a0was finishing up a gas law property demonstration with flammable liquid methane. Some backpacks and papers were damaged, but no students were hospitalized after the fire.\r\n\r\nPAFD Battalion Chief Kevin McNally said that though\u00a0PAFD is in the process of investigating the matter, there may not have been enough smoke in the room to trigger the fire alarm.\r\n\r\n\"It was not a sustained fire,\" McNally said. \"I can speculate that the alarm didn't go off because most of them are smoke detectors, not flame detectors. Unless there's enough smoke produced to\u00a0actually set the alarm off, it won't go off.\"\r\n\r\nWong noted her concern about the apparent fire alarm malfunction.\r\n\r\n\"I was pretty shocked that there had been a literal fiery explosion and the alarm didn\u2019t even go off,\" Wong said. \"There was definitely smoke in the room.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Wong, Paymer\u00a0immediately used the emergency shower, a feature that is installed in every science classroom, to put out the flames on her\u00a0body, and students poured water onto burning items in the room.\r\n\r\n\"It [the fire extinguisher] didn\u2019t get used,\" Wong said. \"I think it\u2019s because all the fires were so small and spread out.\"\r\n\r\nSophomore Jordan Quigley, who was also in the classroom at the time of the fire, said that Paymer\u00a0told a group of students to get help\u00a0from science teacher Ron Bowditch in the room next door. Bowditch then called the paramedics and school personnel.\r\n\r\n\"Paymer\u00a0was pretty calm for what had happened,\" Quigley said.\r\n\r\nAccording to sophomore Aman Mittal, another witness to the explosion, the methane used in the experiment was supposed to spark a flame to propel a plastic container backward. Mittal noted that the experiment failed multiple times and suddenly erupted into flames on the final attempt.\r\n\r\n\"She [Paymer] was working with methane in an empty milk carton to make a reaction happen, but it wouldn't work,\" Mittal said. \"So she kept trying, and I guess all the methane from the previous tries reacted, as in caught fire, and the entire front of the room burst into flames for a split second.\"\r\n\r\nWong said that\u00a0the students were grateful that Paymer\u00a0reacted quickly to the incident.\r\n\r\n\"We\u2019re so lucky that it [the whole classroom] didn't catch on fire and [that] no one else got hurt \u2013 not even people sitting in the front row,\" Wong said.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto Fire Department and Palo Alto High School administration are investigating why a classroom fire alarm failed to go off after a chemistry demonstration yesterday ignited a fire that injured a teacher.","date":"2015-04-02 18:24:55","author":"Lizzie Chun","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/IMG_22931.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"8453":"accident","41255":"aman mittal","41249":"burn","41250":"chem","11624":"chemistry","41252":"experiment","33669":"fire","10447":"fire alarm","41531":"fire department","41253":"jessica wong","41254":"jordan quigley","41529":"kevin mcnally","41530":"pafd","8944":"palo alto high school","8953":"paly","41251":"recovery","41287":"silja paymer","9150":"Teacher"}},{"id":101643,"title":"InFocus travels to SoCal","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/03\/31\/infocus-travels-to-socal\/","content":"&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_75011\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"563\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/MG_55571.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-75011\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/MG_55571.jpg\" alt=\"INfocus Network and Viking Magazine adviser Paul Hoeprich gives students tips on how to take great videos.

On Friday at the Mitchell Park Community Center, Palo\u00a0Alto teens and adults came together for a youth forum\u00a0to encourage\u00a0teenagers\u00a0to have open discussion in a safe environment.\r\n\r\nTeen-selected adult facilitators and students from the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.cityofpaloalto.org\/gov\/depts\/csd\/recreation\/teens\/leadership.aspand\">Teen Advisory Board<\/a>\u00a0and <a href=\"https:\/\/paloaltoyouthcouncil.wordpress.com\/\">Palo Alto Youth Council<\/a>\u00a0led the event, officially titled \u201cIn This Together: A Place to Share, A Place to Support, A Place to Heal.\u201d The two teen groups seek to improve the community by linking teens with\u00a0the general public through the implementation of\u00a0programs that encourage student involvement.\r\n\r\n\u201c[The] teen voice is really important,\u201d TAB and\u00a0PAYC\u00a0member Elinor Aspegren said. \u201cTeens are often told that their opinions don\u2019t matter or that they\u2019re too young to know what they\u2019re talking about. \u2026 And right now, we\u2019ve given them a space to talk about what they\u2019re feeling.\u201d\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"\/\/www.cincopa.com\/media-platform\/iframe.aspx?fid=A4LAdZsnM7_z\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\nThe event kicked off with a few introductory remarks from Aspegren,\u00a0Gunn High School junior\u00a0and master of ceremonies; Rob de Geus, Palo Alto director of community services; and Amal Aziz, youth and teen services director of The City of Palo Alto.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must be intentional [and] authentic and show resolve in our discussion with teens as we go forward,\u201d de Geus said.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, students and adults split into their respective sessions: teen discussion circles and an adult support workshop. Students engaged in three rounds of 25-minute dialogue circles, which covered the topics of \u201cSocial Academic Pressure,\u201d \u201cGrieving, Coping and Dealing with Loss,\u201d \u201cDealing with Stress,\u201d \u201cDefeating Stigma,\u201d \u201cDealing with Depression\u201d and \u201cInclusion, Acceptance and Friendship.\u201d The dialogue circles prompted students to reflect on their own lives in order to offer suggestions for how to improve the community in the future.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt [the forum] gets the conversation going, and that doesn\u2019t happen very much in other circumstances,\u201d Gunn junior Rachel Gates said.\r\n\r\nStudent facilitator and Palo Alto High School senior Emma Chiu and adult facilitator and\u00a0Gunn Oracle adviser Kristy Blackburn led the \u201cSocial Academic Pressure\u201d dialogue circle. Students discussed where academic pressure stems from and how students and adults can change the definition of social academic pressure within Palo Alto. Ideas ranged from not limiting the number of Advanced Placement classes a student can take to counting a smaller achievement, such as winning a video game,\u00a0as a success.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cDealing with Stress\u201d group led by adult facilitator Eric Bloom, Paly\u00a0Social Studies\u00a0and school climate teacher, discussed the causes of stress, how it feels and ways to alleviate it. Some members of the group reported that\u00a0tests, relationships and the future often make them feel hot, tense and filled with nervous energy.\r\n\r\nThe dialogue circles gave students chances\u00a0to be heard and to hear others, according to de Geus.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo listen and to understand can be a very powerful thing,\u201d de Geus said.\r\n\r\nAfter each dialogue session was complete,\u00a0students and adults met during \"Empathy Hour\" to allow facilitators to summarize their discussions with the rest of the forum attendees.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that when we come back and talk about all the things said in the circles, parents and administrators will \u2026 start to realize what teens and adults want,\u201d Aspegren said.\r\n\r\nGates enjoyed the experience to both share and listen to the\u00a0teen attendee's\u00a0ideas.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was a nice to see a lot of different people engaging with each other and hearing different perspectives from people of different parts of the community,\u201d Gates said.\r\n\r\nAccording to Aspegren, the \"In This Together\" forum is just one of many discussions that will begin to\u00a0make a strong connection\u00a0between adults and teens in the community.\r\n\r\n\u201cSome say teenagers are too young \u2026 to make decisions, but I think teenagers have the power to change the world,\u201d Gunn sophomore and TAB\u00a0member Shannon Yang said.","excerpt":"Both teens and adults came together to discuss how to improve community wellbeing and mental health in the City of Palo Alto at a youth forum on Friday at the Mitchell Park Community Center.","date":"2015-03-29 20:34:35","author":"Adele Bloch","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/IMG_8770.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"8611":"Community","41053":"elinor aspegren","11240":"emma chiu","11236":"eric bloom","18368":"forum","8751":"gunn","41054":"kristy blackburn","37655":"mental health","27709":"mitchell park","8939":"palo alto","8944":"palo alto high school","41052":"palo alto youth council","8953":"paly","28786":"payc","41056":"rachel gates","41057":"rob de geus","41055":"shannon yang","9107":"slideshow","9129":"student","39961":"student forum","41051":"tab","27177":"teen","33698":"teen advisory board","40993":"teen forum"}},{"id":101604,"title":"Tryouts for next year&#8217;s cheer, dance and stunt teams start at 3:45 p.m. on April 13 in Dance Studio","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/03\/29\/tryouts-for-next-years-cheer-dance-and-stunt-teams-start-at-345-p-m-on-april-13-in-dance-studio\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2015-03-29 13:28:22","author":"Lizzie Chun","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":{"31304":"cheer","8626":"dance","41059":"stunt","41058":"stunts","9153":"team","41060":"teams","9188":"tryouts"}},{"id":101571,"title":"ASB Election Results 2015-16","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/03\/27\/asb-election-results-2015-16\/","content":"Voting for Palo Alto High School's Associated Student Body officers for the 2015-16 school year\u00a0has come to a close and the results\u00a0are in.

These articles sparked heated debate on online forums like Town Square, though teenagers seem to prefer sharing their opinions through Facebook and Twitter.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #373e4d;\">Carlson hopes\u00a0attending the forum will help support the\u00a0students in her community who have trouble expressing their struggles even on these platforms.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #373e4d;\">\"People should feel like it is okay to discuss suicide, depression, student stress and other troubles openly,\" Carlson said. \"I hope that the forum will help to facilitate honest conversations about the things that often go unmentioned.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #373e4d; font-family: helvetica, arial, 'lucida grande', sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #f6f7f8;\">\u00a0<\/span>","excerpt":"The City of Palo Alto is hosting a youth forum to discuss improving community wellbeing and mental health this Friday at the Mitchell Park Community Center.","date":"2015-03-26 18:56:47","author":"Maya McNealis","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/1969252_888575711181000_3124481212575686117_n.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"8544":"bryn carlson","8611":"Community","40996":"depression","18368":"forum","40994":"in this together","37655":"mental health","27709":"mitchell park","40995":"patrick burt","9135":"suicide","40993":"teen forum"}},{"id":101487,"title":"Meet the quirky side of your ASB candidates","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/03\/26\/meet-the-quirky-side-of-your-asb-candidates\/","content":"<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Palo Alto High School's Associated Student Body elections are officially here, and if\u00a0you feel that you don't know enough about the executive candidates, never fear.
