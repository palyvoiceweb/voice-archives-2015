The freshman will be dressed as babies, the sophomores as teeny bobbers, the juniors as\u00a0sophisticates and the seniors as senior citizens.\r\n\r\nThere will be one rally during lunch, consisting of two activities new to this year: \"Pool Rings\" and \"Name that Tune,\" according to the Associated Student Body\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/sites.google.com\/site\/pahsasb\/sw2015\">website<\/a>.\r\n\r\nFor \u201cPool Rings,\u201d two members of each grade will have one minute to throw a large inflatable pool ring back and forth by catching the ring on their necks. \u00a0Each class will have its own allotted time and there will be a total of four rounds, with classes competing for a 500-point victory.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cName that Tune\u201d event requires four participants per grade, and all grades will be competing in one round. Each team must guess the title of a song playing over the loudspeakers by writing it down on a whiteboard and then running the whiteboard to the center of the field. The first team to name\u00a0a song correctly will be given a point, and the team with the most points will win\u00a0first place, also worth 500 points.\r\n\r\nBest dressed contestants and cheers will also be graded during the lunchtime festivities.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to junior class president Noa Ben-Efraim, there\u00a0will be no Advisory 3-pointer rally this year, breaking the tradition of the last several Spirit Weeks\u00a0because of the\u00a0construction of the Paly gyms.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Freshman Derek Zhou says\u00a0the 3-pointer contest would not have largely impacted his grade\u2019s Spirit Week performance. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cA lot of people [in my grade] are really good at basketball, but we probably aren\u2019t as good as the seniors, so I think it's just one less thing for the freshmen to lose at,\u201d Zhou said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophomore Nandini Relan remains positive about her class's performance despite the 10th graders'\u00a0last place position\u00a0in the \u201cRelay Race\u201d today.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI feel really disappointed at it [the sophomore\u2019s loss],\u201d Relan said, \u201cbut I think we can catch up.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior Matt O\u2019Reilly expresses enthusiasm to don his generational clothing as a \u201csenior citizen.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI\u2019m really excited to dress up as an old person because that's kind of a Paly tradition,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said. \u201cYou come to school seeing everyone looking so good with their big bellies and walkers and I\u2019m just really excited to be able to do that.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">O\u2019Reilly also feels confident in the senior class's performance. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe [the Senior class] stumbled a little bit on the first day, but I think we really stepped up our game,\u201d O'Reilly said.\u00a0 \u201cWe are really the most spirited and I think that reflects in our performance.\u201d<\/span>","excerpt":"As Spirit Week nears the finale of the week, Palo Alto High School students will embody a multitude of ages for \u201cGeneration Day.\"","date":"2015-10-21 18:35:27","author":"Chayenne Greenberg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMG_0907.jpg","categories":["Spirit Week 2015","Spotlight"],"tags":["#palyspirit","3 Point Contest","derek zhou","Generations day","Matt O'Reily","nandini relan","noa ben-efraim","paly spirit","Spirit Week"]}]
