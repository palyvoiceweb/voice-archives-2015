But despite the club\u2019s success as well as its prominent social media presence, quite a few Paly students are unaware of what the club is actually about. Paly DECA co-presidents junior Stephanie Cong and junior Karina Chan help explain the organization\u2019s objectives.\r\n\r\n\u201cDECA is just a club that enhances learning of any business-related topics through competitive conferences,\u201d Cong said.\r\n\r\nDECA, which formerly stood for Distributive Education Clubs of America but is no longer used as an acronym for anything, is a club intended to increase high school students' knowledge of the professional world. Chapters participate in contests at the regional, state and international levels in which students compete in various business-related events. Most of the\u00a0events involve students showcasing their knowledge of a specific field of business, usually by making\u00a0a sales pitch to a series of judges.\r\n\r\n\u201cEach person has a different event,\"\u00a0Chan said.\u00a0\"There are over 50 events offered, so there\u2019s a lot of detail that goes into it, which is why it\u2019s so hard to explain to people.\"\r\n\r\nSo far, Paly DECA has attended the Leadership and Competitive Excellence Conference, an introductory event that offers workshops for DECA members to learn about the events offered and to improve their skills, and the Silicon Valley district conference.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe were pretty successful [in the Silicon Valley conference],\" Chan said\u00a0\"A third of all members who attended placed in their contests.\"\r\n\r\nLast year\u2019s DECA was practically nonexistent, and Chan said\u00a0she was inspired to revitalize the club at Paly after seeing the success of DECA programs at\u00a0other local high schools.\r\n\r\n\u201cOther schools [Gunn, Lynbrook, Monta Vista\u00a0and\u00a0Mission San Jose] have big DECA clubs \u2013 all 200 to 400 people \u2013 and definitely there\u2019s no club like that at Paly,\u201d Chan said.\u00a0\u201cI wanted to start DECA to help give people that kind of experience.\u201d\r\n\r\nBoth presidents attribute DECA\u2019s popularity at Paly to the idea that the club gives people the opportunity to learn valuable skills and gain real-world business experience.\r\n\r\n\u201cA lot of people can see themselves going into the field [hospitality, finance, entrepreneurship, management, marketing] that they are currently studying for DECA,\u201d Cong said. \u201cAs well as that, it [DECA] gives people an opportunity to network with other high school students.\u201d\r\n\r\nTo promote their club, members have taken to social media; on two separate occasions, members have changed their profile pictures on Facebook to DECA-themed images. Cong and Chan both say\u00a0DECA\u2019s social media approach is an effective way to advertise the club and attract potential members.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe know that if people don\u2019t even know what DECA is when we talk to them, we have to have the same conversation over and over,\"\u00a0Cong said.\u00a0\"Having a large social media presence gets our name out there initially.\u201d\r\n\r\nChan asserts that having a dynamic social media presence isn\u2019t the main focus of Paly DECA.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe value of our club is not our social media presence \u2013 it\u2019s what skills we can offer to students,\u201d Chan said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the profile pictures.\"","excerpt":"This year, a new club has risen to prominence at Palo Alto High School: DECA.

In this first installment of a three-part series, The Paly Voice features the youngest and least-experienced members of the Palo Alto High School varsity basketball teams: the freshmen.<\/em>\r\n\r\nThis year, the girls' team features two freshmen, while the boys' team has just one \u2013 the first freshman to make the boys' varsity team since alumnus E.J Floreal, who currently <a title=\"EJ Floreal UK Profile\" href=\"http:\/\/www.ukathletics.com\/sports\/m-baskbl\/mtt\/ej_floreal_862043.html\" target=\"_blank\">plays for the University of Kentucky<\/a>, during the 2009-10 season. All three players possess critical roles for their respective teams, just a handful of months into\u00a0their high school careers.\r\n\r\nRecently, The Paly Voice sat down with the lone freshman on the boys' team, 6' 2\" forward Max Dorward, to discuss his brother's guiding influence, his current role on the team and his bright future in the sport he loves.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_97467\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"624\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/IMG_0298.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-97467\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/IMG_0298.jpg\" alt=\"Freshman forward Max Dorward boxes out his Wilcox opponents during his team's 71-56 win on Jan. 30.

Tell us what that means to you.\r\n\r\nMax Dorward: It's a huge accomplishment for me. I've been playing basketball my entire life, and I worked really hard to get to this point. I'm thankful that I made it onto varsity, but I still would have been very proud of myself if I had made it onto JV. Varsity is a huge, huge accomplishment.\r\n\r\nTPV: There are a lot of experienced players on the varsity team: Kevin [Mullin] and Johnny [Rojahn] in particular, Alex [Dees] as well. Who do you look up to most playing-wise and leadership-wise?\r\n\r\nMD: I think all of our seniors are really good. They're undoubtedly the leaders on our team. Kevin has his traits of leadership while Johnny has the other traits and Alex has some of his traits as well. A combination of all three is really great. Juniors are also a big part \u2013 Oliver [Svirsky], Justin [Hull], Mikey [Grandy], they all possess aspects of leadership. Rather than look at individuals, I really like to look at our entire team and really take a little bit of something from everyone.\r\n\r\nTPV: What is your take on Coach Sax developing you into not just a basketball player at Paly, but also as a student in high school? What has he done to help you transition from the middle school to the high school level?\r\n\r\nMD: Knowing that we are all just in high school, he relates to me and everyone else by bringing in these quotes that really help us just play our games. In practice he also brings in quotes from Macbeth and other novels that he really likes. He can really relate to us well that way.\r\n\r\nTPV: In terms of your current role on the team, you realize that being a freshman means you probably won't get as many opportunities as you will as later as an upperclassmen. This year, though, what do you want your role to be the rest of the season? You're playing a healthy amount for a freshman.\r\n\r\nMD: I was coming into this year expecting to not play at all, similar to how Kevin didn't really play his sophomore year. That year was more of a developing year for the coming seasons. That's what I was expecting. I was really taken back when I began getting a lot of playing time as a freshman. This year, I'm still taking it as a stride for future years to really develop myself and get better as a player.\r\n\r\nTPV: Think about the professional level, just for a moment. Out of all of the NBA players that you could choose from, which one do you look up to most? Not just playing-wise, but also think about who you want to become as a person.\r\n\r\nMD: There's a lot of great players to choose from. People may right away think about Kobe [Bryant], LeBron [James], Kevin Durant. For me, Stephen Curry is my guy. I really like him a lot because he's a leader as well as a great player. He also kind of started out with nobody knowing who he was, and he's worked really hard to get to where he is. I look up to him more than the other great players.\r\n\r\nTPV: You started playing basketball at an early age. Your brother [Lukas Dorward] currently plays over at Gunn. How early did playing varsity basketball become a real possibility in your mind?\u00a0When did that hit you?\r\n\r\nMD: Over this past summer, I played for Coach Sax over summer league. I thought I had a small shot making varsity then. I later found out that I was being asked to try out, and really try and be on the team. That's when it really hit me that I had a really good shot at making varsity.\r\n\r\nTPV: Take the fact that Kevin, who's averaging more than 20 points per game this season, started playing varsity as a sophomore and didn't play very much at all for a moment, and combine it with the fact that you're a freshman already integrated into Coach Sax's rotation. What does that right there say about what you can become?\r\n\r\nMD: I have really high hopes, honestly. Looking up to Kevin, who's a great scorer and a great team player, I really hope to one day exceed Kevin's playing ability. Right now, though, I'm just really focusing on developing and improving my skills.\r\n\r\nTPV: Outside of the school and the team itself, who has helped you the most get to this point?\r\n\r\nMD: Definitely my brother. I look up to him so much. He's been a great mentor to me, having played basketball his entire life, too. This in addition to other sports that he's played, as well. I really look up to him, and he's given me a lot of good advice.\r\n\r\nTPV: Best thing about high school so far?\r\n\r\nMD: Definitely the freedom. No question.\r\n\r\nTPV: Okay, then. What's the worst thing about it?\r\n\r\nMD: I would have to say Mondays. I just don't like the seven period schedule.\r\n\r\nTPV: What is one thing that Paly should know about you as the school gets to witness your growth and potential over the next few years?\r\n\r\nMD: I'm just a young player trying to develop and trying to be the next big guy during my senior year.\r\n\r\n<em>Dorward and the boys' varsity team is currently in first place in the De Anza League, with a league record of 7-2. Their next game is at 7:45 p.m. Feb. 13 at Homestead High School.<\/em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"For the first segment of a three-part series featuring freshmen varsity basketball players, staff writer Josh Yuen sat down with freshman Max Dorward to discuss his brother's guiding influence, his current role on the team and his bright future.

Own Your Health Info is a continuation of the annual Emily's Way project, a program that the Benatar family\u00a0initiated\u00a0last year. Last year's project involved creating cards for military personnel. Emily's mother and creator of Own Your Health Info, Lisa Benatar, noted that the aim of the project is to encourage individuals to advocate for their own health awareness. The goal is to get 1,100 people, including Paly students, to have their medical records available on their phones by Feb. 11, to honor Emily's birthday. \"We want to help people help themselves and be their own best advocate,\" Lisa Benatar said.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_97806\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"229\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/24c4a9_9d0b04fe6cc110af7277a042655855d4.jpg_srz_p_402_603_75_22_0.50_1.20_0.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-97806\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/24c4a9_9d0b04fe6cc110af7277a042655855d4.jpg_srz_p_402_603_75_22_0.50_1.20_0.jpg\" alt=\"Paly graduate Emily Benatar passed away on May 9, 2012 from bacterial meningitis.

Individuals\u00a0with physicians affiliated with\u00a0<a href=\"myhealth.stanfordhealthcare.org\" target=\"_blank\">Stanford Hospital<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"myhealthonline.sutterhealth.org \" target=\"_blank\">Palo Alto Medical Foundation<\/a>\u00a0or\u00a0<a href=\"KaiserPermanente.org\" target=\"_blank\">Kaiser Permanente<\/a>\u00a0can\u00a0go online to learn about digital health records and how set up an account. Teens can also set up an account during an appointment with a physician.\r\n\r\n\"The quickest and easiest way to set up an online account is while you are actually at the doctor\u2019s office \u2014 they will help you set up the account right on the spot,\" Lisa Benatar said. \"The problem is, many teens only go to the doctor every couple of years.\"\r\n\r\nIn order to streamline this process and make it more accessible to teenagers, Lisa Benatar\u00a0created a simple \"FastTrak\" solution that she\u00a0hopes will encourage teenagers to gain a greater understanding of their own health.\r\n\r\n\"All we want students to do is this: Ask your parents to text you a picture of your immunization records,\" Lisa Benatar said. \"That\u2019s it.\"\r\n\r\nOnce students have access to their health records on their phone, whether it's through an online account or an image sent by their parents, Benatar encourages them to contact the Own Your Health Info organization <a href=\"ownyourhealthinfo@gmail.com\" target=\"_blank\">via email<\/a>\u00a0and add their name to\u00a0help reach the 1,100 goal. Students can also <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ownyourhealthinfo.com\/users\/register\" target=\"_blank\">join the campaign by registering online<\/a>.\r\n\r\nThe idea for the Own Your Health project, according to Lisa Benatar, stemmed from her desire to spread awarness about the\u00a0meningococcal disease.\r\n\r\n\"I wanted to raise awareness about the disease, but I couldn\u2019t even tell people to get vaccinated because at the time when I first started thinking about this project, there was no [meningococcal B]\u00a0vaccine available in the U.S,\" Lisa Benatar said.\r\n\r\nAccording to Lisa Benatar, Emily was vaccinated but contracted a strain of the meningococcal disease that was not covered by the vaccination.\r\n\r\n\"[Emily] contracted serogroup B, which is not covered by the vaccine that was the only one available at the time when she was vaccinated,\" Lisa Benatar said. \"Just within the last three months, the FDA has approved two MenB vaccines.\"\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_97827\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"229\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/24c4a9_223f86a0b83c4338998bb35d601a5a6b1.jpg_srz_p_460_431_75_22_0.50_1.20_01.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-97827\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/24c4a9_223f86a0b83c4338998bb35d601a5a6b1.jpg_srz_p_460_431_75_22_0.50_1.20_01.jpg\" alt=\"The Own Your Health Info project continues the Benatar family's tradition of honoring Emily around the time of her birthday.

Photo courtesy of emilybenatar.com.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAfter learning more about the disease and vaccinations, Lisa Benatar hoped that the \"Own Your Health\" campaign\u00a0would help lead to a wider-scale understanding of immunizations and medical history.\r\n\r\n\"At least I could help people with the first step in understanding vaccinations, which is to at least know which ones you\u2019ve had and when,\" Lisa Benatar said. \"That\u2019s how the idea of 'owning your health information' came about.\"\r\n\r\nEmily's sister junior Maya Benatar is one of over 800 people who have added their names to the Own Your Health Info Campaign.\r\n\r\n\"I think this is super important because the transition from high school to college is a tough one and a lot of the time teenagers still rely on their parents for a lot of stuff,\" Maya Benatar said. \"When teenagers go to the doctor in college and are sick they usually don't know certain information about their health in the past that the doctor might need to diagnose them or prescribe them medication.\"\r\n\r\nWith the project, Lisa Benatar hopes to encourage college students to take their health matters into their own hands. The project is designed to help people, young adults in particular, understand their own medical history and have access to their records at all times.\r\n\r\n\"When kids turn 18, it makes sense for them to take on the responsibility of keeping track of their health records because at that point, their parents no longer even have legal access to the records,\" Lisa Benatar said. \"If you\u2019re away from home and have some kind of medical emergency, like a sports injury or any kind of accident or illness, you might need to know things quickly,\u00a0like what medicines you\u2019re allergic to.\"\r\n\r\nLisa Benatar also hopes that the project will encourage parents to play a greater role in helping their children to understand health care.\r\n\r\n\"Parents can help by showing their kids what's involved in healthcare, like finding a doctor ... and getting access to records,\" Lisa Benatar said. \"As one friend of mine put it, when kids go off to college we spend more time picking out bedding than we we do helping them take care of health information.\"","excerpt":"A Palo Alto family recently launched the Own Your Health Info project, a campaign promoting the individual ownership of health and immunization records.","date":"2015-02-07 18:11:32","author":"Hannah Nguyen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/Screen-Shot-2015-02-07-at-9.45.12-PM1.png","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"38419":"emily benatar","38421":"emily's way","38420":"lisa benatar","38423":"medical records","38422":"own your health info"}},{"id":97864,"title":"Liveblog: Basketball vs. Gunn","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/02\/07\/liveblog-basketball-vs-gunn\/","content":"<p><em>Check back in this Saturday beginning at 6 p.m. as Palo Alto High School's girls' and boys' basketball teams host the cross-town rival Gunn High School Titans in a double-header.

McGee also advocated for a community-wide effort to support students in\u00a0all aspects of their well-being, stressing\u00a0that mental health issues are not just a \"school problem.\"\r\n\r\n\"These past two weeks, people have been anxious to understand why [the suicide happened], sometimes quick to blame and generally eager to share their solutions to what they believe the students\u2019 problems are,\" McGee said in his newsletter. \"While the reactions are understandable, it is time to come together as a collective community.\"\r\n\r\nWhile McGee acknowledges that academic stress is not the sole cause of suicide, he emphasizes that change can begin within the school system and urges parents and students to reduce competitiveness at school, underscoring the importance of learning for the sake of learning, not for grades.\r\n\r\n\"It is imperative we remember student health and connectedness do not have to come at the cost of high academic standards,\" McGee said. \"This [students'] sense of curiosity and desire to deepen and apply knowledge is consistent with our [the district's] vision and evidence that we are a community of learners who will be well-prepared for a fulfilling future. However, when students feel they should prize their grades over deeper learning, when the number of AP [Advanced Placement] and honors classes they take matters more than what they experience in these classes or when they are over-competitive with one another or obsessed with checking grades, unhealthy actions can follow. \"\r\n\r\nMcGee has also authorized\u00a0a number of projects to help support students at both high schools, such as conducting a course alignment review, requiring regular meetings with school counselors and advisers and beginning \"mindfulness training,\" in addition to the changes that Diorio hopes to make at Paly.\r\n\r\nMcGee said he hopes to increase the discussion as a community about student wellness. A \"Let's Talk: A Community Conversation about Healthy Kids and Healthy Schools\" event, sponsored by the City of Palo Alto and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.psnpaloalto.com\" target=\"_blank\">Project Safety Net<\/a>, will be held at 7 p.m. on Wednesday, Feb. 25 at the Cubberley Community Center Theatre to help spark a discourse.","excerpt":"Palo Alto Unified School District Superintendent Max McGee and Palo Alto High School Principal Kim Diorio sent emails to parents and students, respectively, addressing ways that the community and school plan to improve student wellness.","date":"2015-02-06 10:15:42","author":"Lizzie Chun","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/IMG_0979.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"38449":"academic stress","8611":"Community","8644":"diorio","8647":"district","8834":"Kim Diorio","37742":"letter","32445":"max mcgee","37655":"mental health","8944":"palo alto high school","8977":"PAUSD","9128":"Stress","11606":"superintendent"}},{"id":97856,"title":"Girls&#8217; soccer looks to win it all","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/02\/05\/girls-soccer-looks-to-win-it-all\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_97861\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/IMG_0282.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-97861 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/IMG_0282.jpg\" alt=\"Senior midfielder Katie Foug carries the ball forward into the Los Gatos half.

They didn't let it get them down.\u201d\r\n\r\nJunior forward and defender Alison Lu also noted the team\u2019s successful\u00a0season but said there are a few things the team can do to reach its ultimate goal\u00a0of\u00a0winning the DAL and later the\u00a0Central Coast Section finals.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe've had many chances in front of the goal but haven't been able to capitalize on those opportunities,\u201d Lu said. \u201cWe're just going to keep practicing and work on starting games off strong. We sometimes start off a bit lackadaisical and have a few moments in the beginning where we don't have full control of the ball.\u201d\r\n\r\nPaly players currently lead the DAL in multiple categories, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.maxpreps.com\/league\/gJhb-VuN5kesTljiplLOEQ\/standings-scval---de-anza.htm#standings\" target=\"_blank\">Maxpreps<\/a>. Junior midfielder Jacey Pederson leads the DAL in goals with 20, while sophomore goalie Dhara Yu leads the league in fewest goals allowed per game, with an average of\u00a00.4. The team as a whole has scored 55 goals, while only allowing seven.\r\n\r\nSeedman noted the excellence of Pederson's performance but also attributed the team\u2019s success to a wide range of players, including Lu, senior Katie Foug and freshman Emily Tomz.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne of our best attributes is our depth,\u201d Seedman said. \u201cWe can put any player out on the field at any juncture and have confidence that they will more than hold their own. Most coaches don't have that flexibility.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith <a href=\"http:\/\/www.maxpreps.com\/rankings\/girls-soccer-winter\/1\/section\/ca\/central+coast+section.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Maxpreps<\/a>' standings placing the Vikings third in CCS, a playoff berth seems inevitable.\r\n\r\n\u201cCan we do it?\" Seedman said. \"Yes.
