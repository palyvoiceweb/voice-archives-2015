Junior Jared Stanley attributed the loss to a sluggish start and emphasized the importance of having the right mindset going into the game.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have played them before but we didn't come\u00a0out firing in the first couple of minutes,\u201d Stanley said. \u201cWe really need to come out hard in the first minutes of this game in order to set the tone.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Stanley, going into the quarterfinal game, the Vikings have the right mentality needed to win.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe had a really good focused practice today, so I believe we are more than capable of coming out with a win against Saint Francis,\u201d Stanley said. \u201cWe know our match ups and it's going to be a great game.\u201d\r\n\r\nJunior Andrew Jozefov says that the team has specifically been working on the team\u2019s defense during practice this week in order to prepare for Saint Francis.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo prepare ourselves for this game, we have been working on sharpening our one-on-one drive defense because that was our biggest weakness last time we lost to them this season,\u201d Jozefov said. \u201cThis time we know that our drive defense, our press and our crash on set will be better and sharper because we know that they [Saint Francis] had trouble against it last time.\u201d\r\n\r\nJozefov also highlighted Bellarmine, a team they have not played this season and Gunn, a team they split their series with this season, as teams that will be tough in their CCS playoff bracket.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe tough teams this year in CCS are Bellarmine and Gunn,\" Jozefov said. \"To beat Gunn all we need to do is have the same focused mentality and drive to win. In order to beat Bellarmine, we will need to play some great counter-defense and really communicate to each other on defense to stop their quick and effective counter.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Vikings are optimistic that they will reach the CCS finals, a season-long goal.\r\n\r\n\"We are very excited going into CCS because this is what the whole season has led to,\" senior Winston Rosati said. \"We want to win and I think if all the parts come together it is possible. I am excited and hopeful.\"","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School water polo team (12-12, 8-5) will open their Central Coast Section (CCS) playoffs campaign against Saint Francis High School at 11:30 a.m. on Saturday at Los Altos High School. \r\n","date":"2015-11-13 23:43:55","author":"Chirag Akella","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/BoysWaterPolo2.jpg","categories":["Sports","water polo"],"tags":["Boys","boys water polo","CCS","jozefov","stanley","vikings","water polo"]},{"id":111936,"title":"Cross country prepares for CCS Championship","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/11\/13\/cross-country-prepares-for-ccs-championship\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_111953\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"606\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/x.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-111953\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/x.jpg\" alt=\"The Palo Alto High School boys\u2019 cross country team warms up during practice at the Paly track.

While the bread was a bit hard, the sandwich had fresh ingredients and the avocado was appetizing. Both the turkey and cheese were flavorful, although the condiments were bland.

Photo by MGM\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" \/><\/a> James Bond has returned within the new film, \"Spectre.\" Overall the film is satisfactory, but plot details take away from the action scenes and the story itself. Photo by MGM.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe James Bond franchise has returned with the thrilling new chapter to the Bond series, \"Spectre.\" The film continues the traditions from previous eras and as well as the story from recent Bond films while paving its own path, differentiating it from other Bond films. Its exciting sequences, iconic references and humorous script is sure to please both casual and die-hard Bond fans alike.\r\n\r\n\"Spectre,\" directed by Sam Mendes, begins with an opening sequence in Mexico City that rivals some of the best opening sequences in the series. The sequence follows Bond (Daniel Craig) tracking down a mysterious villain through the town square during the festive Day of the Dead celebrations. Bond then engages in a brilliantly shot helicopter fight scene which caps the action-packed opening scene. The rest of the movie follows Bond\u2019s quest to track down a person from his past and to take down the terrorist organization, Spectre.\r\n\r\nOne way \"Spectre\" succeeds is that it incorporates all the classic Bond moments that old fans will love. The introduction of \"Bond, James Bond?\" Check. Shaken, not stirred? Yup. The timeless Aston Martin? Of course. There are even many references to past films (\"From Russia With Love\" train scene, anyone?). However, where this film differs from the majority of the series is in its exploration of Bond\u2019s (Daniel Craig) past, a continuing theme from all of Craig\u2019s past Bond films.\r\n\r\nThough the exploration of Bond\u2019s past was done very well in Craig's previous movies (namely \"Casino Royale\" and \"Skyfall\"), in \"Spectre\" it distracts rather than adds to the plot. Extended monologues takes away from the action scenes and slows the pace of the movie. Also, the focus on Bond\u2019s past does not accentuate Bond\u2019s traditional mysterious and stoic nature and makes him much softer than previous films. It also leads to an unorthodox ending that combined with rumors of \"Spectre\" being Craig\u2019s final Bond film, fuels many rumors regarding the plot of the next film, \"Bond 25.\"\r\n\r\nDespite those issues, \"Spectre\" succeeds in many ways. Supporting characters Eve Moneypenny (Naomie Harris), Q (Ben Whishaw) and M (Ralph Fiennes) continue their strong performances from \"Skyfall.\" Harris plays a great sidekick to Bond while Whishaw does a phenomenal job adding funny moments and continuing to play an exceptional younger Q. Fiennes also does a good job taking over from the longtime Judie Dench as M, incorporating the steely attitude needed for the character. The script is well done, incorporating humor throughout while still retaining the darker feel regarding Bond's past. The cinematography is shot very well, as the action scenes were captivating and intense. The different locations Bond ventures into, such as Mexico City and Rome, are captured well by the directing, the clothing is classy and fashionable, and the explosions are bigger than ever.\r\n\r\nChristoph Waltz (Ernst Blofeld) plays a phenomenal antagonist. Waltz\u2019s idiosyncratic acting fits seamlessly with the role of \u201cOberhauser,\u201d but there is one problem \u2013 there was not enough of him. The first half of the film foreshadows Oberhauser to be an extremely powerful and invincible villain. However, when he is on-screen, he gives too many monologues and isn\u2019t able to have the same impact as past villains such as Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem) from \"Skyfall.\"\r\n\r\nDespite the divergence from the traditional Bond script, \"Spectre\" still retains the traditional Bond moments die-hard fans will look for, and its enthralling action scenes and humorous moments make it a must-watch even for the casual moviegoer.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"The James Bond franchise has returned with another hit film, \"Spectre.\" The film follows  Bond's attempt to track down a foe from his past and take down a terrorist organization.

In the game show, audience members\u00a0make deals with the show's host.\u00a0The host offers contestants something of value, such as cash, and contestants must choose whether to keep the object or trade it for a mystery item.\r\n\r\n\u201cMost of my friends and family were pretty shocked when they found out I was on the show, mostly because I hadn't mentioned it before,\u201d Mackris said. \u201cThe show taped in June, but I wasn't allowed to tell anyone that I was a contestant until the show aired.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the show, Mackris avoided purchasing a zonk; an object with little value to the buyer. She later turned down another unknown item, revealed to be a trip to the Caribbean island St. Lucia.\r\n\r\n\u201cI actually don't regret missing out on the trip to St. Lucia,\u201d Mackris said. \u201cIt would have been a cool experience but if I had won the trip I still probably would have traded it for the big deal of the day at the end of the show and would have ended up with the motorcycle anyway.\u201d\r\n\r\nFinally, she purchased a game room which she later traded for a \u201cbig deal\u201d mystery item. While Mackris won a motorcycle and avoided the meager prize of $2,160, she lost out on a Chevy Sonic Sedan worth $25,879.\r\n\r\nMackris plans on selling the motorcycle.\r\n\r\n\u201cThose who know me know that I'm the farthest thing from a \u2018biker chick,\u2019 so I got a lot of people asking me if I was actually going to ride it or not,\u201d she said.\r\n\r\nDespite not receiving the grand prize, Mackris says she enjoyed the experience.\r\n\r\n\u201cI would absolutely love to be on 'Let's Make A Deal' again, even if I was just in the audience,\u201d Mackris said. \u201cThe energy in the studio that day was unlike anything I had experienced before and by the time we left that day we all felt like one big family.\u201d","excerpt":"A Palo Alto High School alumna won a new motorcycle on the CBS channel game show \u201cLet\u2019s Make a Deal\u201d that aired last Wednesday.","date":"2015-11-11 16:27:15","author":"Adrienne Kwok","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/12195773_935542996529214_7788620552987236578_n.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["alum","game show","lets make a deal","molly mackris","motorcycle","palo alto high school","paly","rhubarb","st lucia","television","tv"]},{"id":111766,"title":"Liveblog: Volleyball open playoffs against Sequoia","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/11\/11\/liveblog-volleyball-open-playoffs-against-sequoia\/","content":"Check back at 7 p.m. for live coverage as Palo Alto High School girls\u2019 volleyball team takes on Sequoia\u00a0High School in the first round of Central Coast Section playoffs.\r\n<div id=\"liveblog-111304\">\u00a0[liveblog]","excerpt":"Check back at 7 p.m. for live coverage as Palo Alto High School girls\u2019 volleyball team takes on Sequoia High School in the first round of Central Coast Section playoffs.\r\n","date":"2015-11-11 16:26:14","author":"Sherwin Amsbaugh","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/IMG_3571.jpg","categories":["Sports","Volleyball"],"tags":["CCS","first round","girls","liveblog","playoffs","Sequoia High School","varsity","volleyball"]},{"id":111629,"title":"Liveblog: Republicans fight it out in debate","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/11\/10\/liveblog-republicans-fight-it-out-in-debate\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_110912\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"576\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/Sherwins-voice-stuff.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-110912\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/Sherwins-voice-stuff.jpg\" alt=\"Republican presidential candidates will go head to head at tonight's debate on Fox.

Is it the powerful rule of the Greek gods or the tales of the humans that worship them? Do you remember grand stories of heroism about slaying horrendous monsters? In \u201cThe Odyssey,\u201d the Palo Alto High School Theater Department aims to bring the world of ancient Greece back to life and showcases the long journey of Odysseus on his return home from the Trojan War. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of the play, written by playwright Mary Zimmerman, chronicles the enormous amount of obstacles Odysseus (senior Ophir Sneh) faces during his journey, including an angry cyclops, enchanting sirens, vindictive gods and rowdy lords. However, the difficulties endure after his return, as Odysseus must fight to restore the life he had before the war. Along the way, the goddess Athena (senior Sophie Swezey), Odysseus' son, Telemachus (junior Jackson Kienitz) and other characters help Odysseus. His grieving wife Penelope (senior Molly Kraus) fights off suitors who wish to marry her since her husband Odysseus is presumed dead. Though it is usually clear what is going on, the short modern-day element at the beginning of the play is slightly confusing and seems irrelevant to the rest of the plot.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The cast members do a great job of capturing the essence of their characters. The dialogue is understandable, and the story is portrayed nicely whether it is a lighthearted, fun moment or a serious scene. Odysseus, with his sincerity and determination, is convincing in his image of a hero, and is nicely balanced by the loud and foolish actions of rowdy nobles (senior Matthew O\u2019Reilly, junior Jason Pollak and senior Daniel Cottrell). A\u00a0silent muse shows\u00a0the audience, through body movements, the transferring of ideas from gods to mortals in a fluid, creative manner.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The show features one main set with a backdrop of waves, clouds and rocks. Throughout the play, the location and time period is projected onto the stage to help clarify the plot. Greek columns are cleverly lifted on and off stage depending on the scene, and a platform in the back showcases the presence of the Olympic gods. The huge puppet used to create the character of the cyclops is a particularly impressive prop, and adds a dramatic feel to an action-packed scene. The presence of a boat is smartly substituted by artfully arranged chairs, convincing pole movements to represent rowing and characters that sway to the drift of the faux ocean. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The characters\u2019 costumes showcased great attention to detail, with a modern twist on some of the garments and accessories such as necklaces and headpieces. Although the torn tunics, leggings and pants of some of the characters were simple, they seemed authentic to their station. The goddesses had interesting, flowing dress variations and the make-up on the nymph Calypso (junior Nadia Leinhos) is particularly beautiful. In instances when characters were \u201cdisguised,\u201d clever costume switches that do not disguise the actual identity of the character are utilized.<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_111537\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/unnamed.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-111537\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/unnamed.jpg\" alt=\"Calypso (junior Nadia Leinhos) holds Odysseus captive on her island, rendering him unable to return home to Ithaca.

Recorded music, <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/10\/06\/alumnus-composes-music-for-fall-production\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">composed by alumnus Jonathan Shue<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as well as live music provided by student musicians junior Edward Park and junior Laura Sieh, accompanies the actors during almost every scene with an assortment of instruments such as bajo sexto, drums and wind chimes. The calm and melodic music makes watching it much more entertaining and helps to fully immerse the audience into ancient Greece. Interesting and artistic use of scarves and chairs as props during dance sequences made scene changes flow smoothly and helped set the tone for the next scene. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An epic saga that includes elements of adventure, romance and tragedy, \u201cThe Odyssey\u201d is a production that does justice to Homer\u2019s classic poem. It will please the eyes and ears of theater-goers of almost any age, though small children might get restless with\u00a0the two hours and 30 minutes running length. Although the first act seems to move a little slowly, the second act picks up momentum and carries it to the end, providing for a satisfying conclusion.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe Odyssey\u201d has four more showings on Nov. 7, Nov. 8, Nov. 12 and Nov. 13. All shows begin at 7:30 p.m. in the Haymarket Theater, except for the Sunday show on Nov. 8, which begins at 2 p.m. <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/palytheatre.seatyourself.biz\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tickets<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are $7 for students and seniors and $10 for adults.<\/span>","excerpt":"In \u201cThe Odyssey,\u201d the Palo Alto High School Theater Department aims to bring the world of ancient Greece back to life and showcases the long journey of Odysseus on his return home from the Trojan War.","date":"2015-11-07 13:51:24","author":"Ana Caklovic","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/unnamed.jpg","categories":["Entertainment","Reviews","Spotlight"],"tags":["acting","athena","calypso","clara baker","daniel cottrell","greek","jackson kienitz","jason pollak","journey","matthew o'reilly","molly kraus","mythology","odysseus","Ophir Sneh","palo alto high school theater department","paly","play","production","review","show","sophie swezey","the odyssey","theater"]}]
