Some shared the article and denounced it completely, others thought the community's collective reaction\u00a0was\u00a0excessive \u2014 many more opinions fell\u00a0in between.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The article, \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/magazine\/archive\/2015\/12\/the-silicon-valley-suicides\/413140\/\" target=\"_blank\">The Silicon Valley Suicides<\/a>,\u201d by Hanna Rosin, explores topics concerning the suicides that have occurred in Palo Alto over the last few years. Rosin chronicles the two recent suicide clusters and goes on to discuss affluence, race, parenting styles, academic environment and the overall culture of Palo Alto as related to the suicides. This story is the latest in a flurry of articles on Palo Alto written by local and national publications, including\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/04\/26\/sunday-review\/push-dont-crush-the-students.html\" target=\"_blank\">The New York Times<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vice.com\/read\/student-teaching-0000748-v22n9\" target=\"_blank\">Vice<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.npr.org\/2015\/05\/10\/405694832\/in-palo-altos-high-pressure-schools-suicides-lead-to-soul-searching\" target=\"_blank\">National Public Radio<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/terry-connelly\/recovering-from-suicide-i_b_7465234.html\" target=\"_blank\">Huffington Post<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sfgate.com\/bayarea\/article\/Why-are-Palo-Alto-s-kids-killing-themselves-6270854.php\" target=\"_blank\">San Francisco Magazine<\/a>.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Palo Alto High School Principal Kim Diorio is highlighted in the piece, and she says the article is not as she initially expected it to be. Among other things, she is not pleased with its imagery, placement as a cover story and the choice to name students\u2019 names.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI was under the impression that she wanted to write something a little more positive,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cIf I could do it all again and wave my magic wand, I would have kept my mouth shut and not talked to her [Rosin].\u201d <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Diorio says she is concerned about the possible negative effects the\u00a0article could have on certain students and community members.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThat's one of my biggest worries, is will this re-trigger some of those feelings, some of that ideation, because that's what the data suggests can happen with that media attention,\u201d Diorio said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_112560\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"252\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/12240996_10153792383468487_765764764809420000_o.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-112560\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/12240996_10153792383468487_765764764809420000_o.jpg\" alt=\"The cover of The Atlantic Magazine's December 2015 issue.

The image and headline met with backlash and accusations of sensationalism from some community members. Courtesy of The Atlantic[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Diorio, her only quote\u00a0featured in the article was taken out of context. The article reads, \u201cDiorio says she often asks kids what they do for fun, \u2018and they can\u2019t answer that question.\u2019\u201d <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI know our students know how to have fun,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cIt [the quote] was said in the sense that students do not have enough free time. \u2026 We just got our Challenge Success survey results back and it says students only have about 40 minutes of free time a day. That\u2019s not a lot of time for downtime.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to both Diorio and PAUSD Supt. Max McGee, the timing of the article, one year after the death of a Gunn student by suicide, is one of the factors that contributed to their reproachful reactions.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI thought it was grossly insensitive to release it in November, a year after one of the students died by suicide, and frankly I was really worried it might trigger something, another tragedy,\u201d McGee said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why any publisher would do that.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">McGee, however, did applaud the author\u2019s effort to avoid oversimplifying such a convoluted issue.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThat\u2019s really important because people are quick to point the finger and blame someone for a suicide, but I think she did a good job of saying this is really complicated,\u201d McGee said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before the article was published,<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> senior and Verde Magazine Co-Managing Editor Siddharth Srinivasan was wary, saying he did not expect The Atlantic \u201cto uncover anything different than other articles in the past.\u201d<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Like much of the student body, Srinivasan felt ambivalent after reading it \u2014 he did not repudiate the author\u2019s claims altogether, but found numerous problems with the approach. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIn some aspects, the research was more thorough and more well done than I expected and in some aspects it was more sensationalized than I expected,\u201d Srinivasan said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Junior Andrea O\u2019Riordan took issue with the lurid description of the train tracks in the introduction as well as the ending line of the article, which reads: \"They\u2019re kids, so they can still forget.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThat [the ending] just struck me as being so, so wrong to insinuate that just because we\u2019re still minors, we can forget traumatic experiences,\u201d she said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In spite of the sensationalism, Srinivasan said he appreciated the author\u2019s incorporation of scientific studies, such as the \u201cU-curve\u201d phenomenon.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019s definitely interesting that she chose to bring the studies in because it really relates it to a more national issue rather than focusing in on particularly Palo Alto,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that was important to get the balance of student voice and clinical study.\u201d <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Srinivasan, the article\u2019s style of narration gives too much creative control to the author, which could embed a hidden bias within the story.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIf <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019m just a reader who does not have much knowledge about the Palo Alto community other than what\u2019s in the article I feel like I\u2019m swayed to a direction which is purely imposed by the writer herself,\u201d Srinivasan said. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cChoosing to narrate about the students rather than have them speak for themselves \u2014 I feel like it doesn't represent the students as well as it could have.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gunn High School senior and editor-in-chief of the Gunn Oracle Shawna Chen echoed this sentiment, saying that the article would have had more journalistic merit if Rosin had spoken to more students. Furthermore, Chen pointed out that by making only cursory references to the schools\u2019 various campaigns to combat the issue of student stress, Rosin conveyed a sense of defeatism.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI can\u2019t say that what her article said isn\u2019t true,\u201d Chen said. \u201cBut if she spent some time talking about the growth we\u2019ve had as a community, how we\u2019ve changed, how we\u2019ve moved past it, all these different initiatives that have been taken by parents and adults and students, I think that would have given students hope.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It remains contested whether this article offers crucial\u00a0new\u00a0insights on the problem at hand or if it is a piece tainted\u00a0with sensationalism, perhaps\u00a0even both,\u00a0but one thing is certain \u2014 it has helped to paint a stark picture of Palo Alto.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI don't want our reputation nationally and beyond our community to be just about this,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cI wish there was a way to change the narrative so that our story is, \u2018Look at all the amazing things we do, and look at all the talented students we have, and look at all the compassion and care and look at how we've come together as a community and responded to this tragedy.\u2019\u201d<\/span>","excerpt":"As soon as the cover of the Atlantic Magazine\u2019s December 2015 edition, a melancholy-inducing image of a teenage boy with his head buried in his hands, surfaced on social media it ignited an emotional maelstrom in the Palo Alto community.","date":"2015-12-02 20:00:26","author":"Emily Hwang","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/atlantic.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["andrea o'riordan","article","atlantic","diorio","hanna rosin","McGee","new york times","shawna chen","siddharth srinivasan","suicide"]},{"id":112592,"title":"Boys&#8217; soccer looks to conquer challenges, win league","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/12\/02\/boys-soccer-looks-to-conquer-challenges-win-league\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_112606\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"598\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/Screen-Shot-2015-12-01-at-11.31.04-AM.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-112606\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/Screen-Shot-2015-12-01-at-11.31.04-AM.png\" alt=\"captionsnsnsnsn\" width=\"598\" height=\"302\" \/><\/a> Junior defender Brian Tracy competes against a Los Gatos High School forward to win possession last year on the Vikings' Senior Night.

They will be difficult to replace. We will have to see how this years\u2019 seniors and juniors can step in and play near last year\u2019s high levels.\u201d\r\n\r\nDespite these losses, the players remain hopeful and hardworking going into this season. According to senior midfielder Siddharth Srinivasan, the team is well rounded in player skill, which will help with keeping play at a high level throughout the season.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are not reliant on one or two players and have good depth in every position, which is important if we want to be consistent in the long-run,\u201d Srinivasan said.\r\n\r\nThe team\u2019s league-winning past is something it is looking to repeat and build on, according to senior goalkeeper Eli Friedlander.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have a strong group, and I think we have a good shot at winning [De Anza] league again,\u201d Friedlander said. \u201cHopefully we will go deeper into CCS [Central Coast Section]. I expect that we will be competitive in every game we play.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Briggs, the team\u2019s formation is still developing, and players may be switched around to accommodate and improve connections.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are putting emphasis on modified medium-sized scrimmages to see where players fit in best defensively and offensively,\u201d Briggs said.\r\n\r\nPlaying a fast-paced possession style game will be a challenge for the team this year, according to junior center midfielder Jack Stoksik.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe need to work on our sharpness in passing and moving,\u201d Stoksik said. \u201cWe are often too slow to react to a good pass or to know when to break the line.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe team\u2019s long history and familiarity with each other\u2019s playing styles will benefit the team as a whole, according to senior midfielder Dami Bolarinwa.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are a team full of chemistry,\" Bolarinwa said. \"We have players that have been playing together for a long time and they know each other's strengths and weaknesses.\"\r\n\r\nThe Vikings are set to kick off their first regular season game at 3:30 p.m. on Thursday at the Paly soccer field against the Milpitas Trojans (0-0, 0-0).","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School boys' soccer team (0-0, 0-0) is focusing on living up to its success of past seasons, despite major losses in its starting lineup.","date":"2015-12-02 19:26:06","author":"Emma van der Veen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/Screen-Shot-2015-12-01-at-11.31.04-AM.png","categories":["Sports"],"tags":["alex bonomi","briggs","CCS","dami bolarinwa","de anza league","eli friedlander","jack stoksik","milpitas","preston kuppe","preview","season preview","siddharth srinivasan","Soccer","wesley woo"]},{"id":112558,"title":"Season Recap: Volleyball falls to San Benito in CCS playoffs","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/12\/02\/season-recap-volleyball-falls-to-san-benito-in-ccs-playoffs\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_112562\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"588\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/Volleyball-2.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-112562\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/Volleyball-2.png\" alt=\"The Palo Alto High School girls' volleyball team celebrates after Senior middle blocker Claire Krugler gets a block against Mountain View High School.

It was a tough loss for us because it ended our season, and for the seniors it was their last high school game, and for a couple it was their last volleyball game ever.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis was the final match for seniors Claire Krugler, Clara Chiu, Claire Dennis, and Gabby Bains.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe loss against San Benito was very disappointing,\" Dennis said. \"We knew it was going to be a challenging team, and we hung in there through the fifth set but being so close to winning and going on to playoffs and falling short is extremely frustrating regardless. I had an amazing experience at Paly competing in sports.\u201d\r\n\r\nOverall, first year head coach Jekara Wilson led the team to a successful record of 24-13, an improvement from last year's\u00a0record of 19-12.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am pleased with the outcome of the season,\" Jekara said, \"At the end of the day, I would have loved to have beaten San Benito in the CCS quarterfinals since we were so close, but even though we fell short of the win, I am so proud of the girls efforts. \u201d\r\n\r\nThe Vikings will build off of several returning players, including sophomore Chelsea Fan, junior Jessica Lee and Fiona Green, who believe that next season they can make it all the way to the state tournament.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think since the majority of the team will be returning to play together next year, we will be a much stronger team as a whole,\u201d Green said. \"We will be much better at working together since we have played together before.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith a strong returning lineup and more experience at the coaching position, the team has high expectations for next season.\r\n\r\n\u201cOur goals for next season will be to come first in league, to come in either first or second in CCS, and possibly even further,\u201d Green said.","excerpt":"Palo Alto High School girls' volleyball team(24-13, 7-5) is looking forward to next season after its loss to San Benito High School (30-7, 11-1) in the second round of the Central Coast Section playoffs. \r\n","date":"2015-12-02 19:23:11","author":"Victor Carlsson","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/Volleyball-2.png","categories":["Sports","Spotlight","Volleyball"],"tags":[]},{"id":112677,"title":"Season Recap: Football falls in CCS semi-final to Milpitas","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/12\/02\/season-recap-football-falls-in-ccs-semi-final-to-milpitas\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_112678\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"702\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/rsz_img_1343.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-112678\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/rsz_img_1343.jpg\" alt=\"Senior wide receiver Eli Givens prepares for the snap during a game against San Benito, Givens is one of many seniors leaving next season.

The main thing I think we need to improve on is our confidence and knowledge in the game.\u201d\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School girls\u2019 water polo team (16-13, 7-5) concluded its season with a 12-5 loss to Leland High School in the Central Coast Section semifinals on Nov. 18.","date":"2015-12-02 15:28:36","author":"Sam Lee","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/12062844_146300709052487_873887724_o.jpg","categories":["Sports","Sports Recap","Spotlight","Uncategorized","water polo"],"tags":["CCS","finals","girls","water","water polo"]},{"id":112411,"title":"ASB introduces new kickball event","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/12\/01\/asb-introduces-new-kickball-event\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_112633\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"599\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/Javier.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-112633\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/Javier.jpg\" alt=\"Sophomore Class President tJaiveer Sandhu practices for the new kickball event.

We\u2019ve seen other schools and other ASB's do something similar. It\u2019s a sport that doesn\u2019t require a lot of practice or lots of setup and basically everybody can kick a ball.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording\u00a0to junior class vice president Natalie Maloney, free cocoa will be given to spectators.\r\n\r\nHall said that the goal of the kickball event was to increase inclusiveness among the student body.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe can also get a lot of people on the team,\u201d Hall said. \u201cOur goal is to be inclusive and let a lot of people play. So if you\u2019ve got 12 people out on the field, and you are rotating people in and out, you can get 20 or more people on a team.

In addition, it [coding] builds on their [students] problem solving, critical thinking and creative skills.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Event organizers aim to make the \"Code Fest\"\u00a0a district wide event.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt is very exciting that we can organize the 'Code Fest' district-wide,\u201d Kolhatkar said. \u201cOur team includes teachers, a couple of administrators, parents and students from our elementary, middle and high school levels, making it a truly unified effort.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The \"Code Fest\" will overlay with the week-long \"Hour of Code,\" which is an event that was started by the nonprofit\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/code.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">code.org<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> three years ago to introduce computer science to students, according to Kolhatkar.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the event, high schoolers will learn how to apply computer science in various ways.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cHigh schoolers can expect mobile devices and a range of robots,\u201d Kolhatkar said. \u201cEach of which will be accompanied by a set of challenges for various abilities. They will get hands-on time with every tool that they are introduced to. Each session is 50 minutes so they can work through at least one challenge with people guiding them if needed.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event schedule will consist of three sessions during which students can experience some of 30 different areas of coding, ranging from iPads to robots, according to the \"Code Fest\" flyer.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1:00-1:25: Event Kick-Off<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1:30-2:25: Session 1<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2:30-3:25: Session 2 <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3:30-4:25: Session 3<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4:30-4:50: Closing <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though the \"Code Fest\" will not make students masters at computer science, organizers hope that students will walk away with more interest in the field. \u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe program will introduce students to coding and go further in-depth with those who already have a basic knowledge,\u201d Kolhatkar said. \u201cBecause one 50 minute session will not do justice to the range that is Computer Science, the hope is that everyone walks away with writing at least some lines of code, and with an excitement and eagerness to continue down the path, incorporating the skills into their lives.\u201d<\/span>","excerpt":"The Palo Alto Unified School District will be hosting its first free Code Fest for K-12 students as an introduction to coding from  1 to 5 p.m. on Dec. 12 at JLS Middle School.","date":"2015-12-01 10:43:23","author":"Will Zhou","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/Programming.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["code fest","computer science","java","pause"]},{"id":112463,"title":"Boys&#8217; water polo optimistic after disappointing finish to season","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/11\/30\/boys-water-polo-optimistic-after-disappointing-finish-to-season\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_112534\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/WaterPoloPractice1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-112534\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/WaterPoloPractice1.jpg\" alt=\"Junior Andrew Jozefov looks to pass during the a Vikings' practice.

Last year, the team exited the playoffs one stage earlier.\r\n\r\nJunior Jared Stanley said he thought that the team could have done better in the CCS playoffs.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe past season went very well, but we were hoping to get a little bit further in CCS,\u201d Stanley said. \u201cIt was disappointing to lose in the quarterfinals of CCS. It was also disappointing to not perform as we had expected to in the league tournament as we were hoping to play in the league final.\u201d\r\n\r\nJunior Andrew Jozefov said that a lack of focus from the team ultimately led to its loss.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe had a few dedicated guys who performed well this year,\u201d Jozefov said. \u201cWe didn't necessarily have everyone on the team working with the same mentality, which didn't exactly help the team.\u201d\r\n\r\nJozefov said that the Vikings will have high goals going into next season.\r\n\r\n\u201cNext year we plan on winning leagues and beating Gunn [High School] in league play,\u201d Jozefov said. \u201cHopefully we can earn a good seed for CCS and get a bye into the semis so we have a solid chance at making some good things happen against some of the top private schools.\u201d\r\n\r\nDespite losing eight seniors including Kevin Bowers, Justyn Cheung, Christian Laurence, Ryan Reed, Luke Coleman, Cameron Kahn and Winston Rosati, the Vikings are very optimistic for the future and believe they will have the experience necessary to do well in the CCS playoffs next year. According to Stanley, the team will have a majority of senior starters as there are many current juniors who can step up. However, even though the team will have enough experience, Stanley recognized the importance of the team's mentality.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe will have almost a full senior starting lineup next year and as a result hope to definitely be serious contenders for CCS finals,\" Stanley said. \"In order to do so we need to practice hard in the off season and treat every game like it's our last.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School boys' water polo team (12-13, 8-6) looks toward a fresh start next year after a disappointing end to its season.","date":"2015-11-30 20:50:12","author":"Chirag Akella","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/WaterPoloPractice.jpg","categories":["Sports","Spotlight","water polo"],"tags":["boys water polo","CCS","jozefov","stanley","vikings","water polo"]},{"id":112531,"title":"ASB Movie Night &#8220;Home Alone&#8221; is this Friday, Dec. 4 in the Media Arts Center","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/11\/30\/asb-movie-night-home-alone-is-this-friday-dec-4-in-the-media-arts-center\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2015-11-30 15:47:10","author":"Josh Yuen","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]},{"id":112529,"title":"ASB Kickball Game is this Friday, Dec. 4 during lunch","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/11\/30\/asb-kickball-game-is-this-friday-dec-4-during-lunch\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2015-11-30 15:45:39","author":"Josh Yuen","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]}]
