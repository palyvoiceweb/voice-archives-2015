However,\u00a0it\u00a0will be used toward improving the Paly campus as a part of the Strong Schools Bond Program according to Berkson.\r\n\r\n\"There's a lot of decision-making going on right now,\" Berkson said. \"We have the new gym coming up, the library project, the science project and we have several smaller projects that would be great with that money. Once the big projects are finished,\u00a0we may also do some internal construction in some of the buildings. But down the line, any of those would have to be voted on to spend the money.\"\r\n\r\nThe lawsuit filed by Taisei Construction Corporation was in the amount of $3,793,000 against PAUSD, Deem Lewis McKinley Architecture and the construction manager Gilbane. The settlement has been reached by all parties with payments from each, according to the press release.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto Unified School District has agreed to pay $540,000 to settle a $3.5 million lawsuit regarding a breach of contract during the construction of two new Palo Alto High School buildings.","date":"2014-12-21 21:56:23","author":"Takaaki Sagawa","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/Screen-Shot-2014-12-19-at-9.38.14-PM.png","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"34444":"$","34371":"3.5","34368":"5400000","34367":"buildings","8616":"construction","34372":"DLM","34365":"dollars","8690":"facilities","34362":"lawsuit","18366":"mac","34428":"math building","34369":"million","34370":"millions","8893":"money","8912":"new","8944":"palo alto high school","8977":"PAUSD","9069":"School Board","34363":"settlement","34366":"Taisei"}}]
