[{"id":96225,"title":"From a #SSS: To ED or not to ED?","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/04\/14\/from-a-sss-to-ed-or-not-to-ed\/","content":"It's a transitioning time of the year. Seniors are winding down their college process as the May 1 deadline approaches, which leaves it to juniors to start their own college search.\r\n\r\nAs two seniors who've both completed applying to colleges, we thought that we might pass along some advice to those looking ahead.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple different ways to apply to college. We will be focusing on Early Decision (ED), but students also apply using other paths like Regular Decision (RD) or Early Action (EA). ED is a big decision to make since it is a binding contract that typically requires a signed agreement that if the college or university accepts, you will attend.\r\n\r\n<strong>Pros:\u00a0<\/strong><em>Written by\u00a0Liana who applied ED.<\/em>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_96455\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"293\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/DSC_0117.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-96455\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/DSC_0117.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_0117\" width=\"293\" height=\"441\" \/><\/a> The pros are written by Liana who chose to apply Early Decision. Photo by Maddy Jones.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>1. Higher acceptance rates<\/strong>\r\n\r\nMany selective schools have much higher acceptance rates during the ED round. According to a New York Times <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/interactive\/2013\/04\/15\/education\/thechoice-2013-acceptance-rates.html\">article<\/a>, in 2013, many schools like Brown and Johns Hopkins had around double the acceptance rates in their early rounds. Brown accepted 18.54 percent of early applicants while only accepting 8.07 percent of regular applicants. Likewise, Johns Hopkins accepted 36.68 percent during the early round and 15.28 percent during the regular round. Duke\u2019s acceptance rate was almost three times as high during its ED round, and Amherst took 39 percent of its early applicants but only 11.5 percent of its regular applicants. The higher acceptance rates are one of the most attractive qualities of early decision, and was a main factor in my choice to apply early.\r\n\r\n<em>Note: Part of the reason that the ED acceptance rate is higher is that recruited athletes are included in the ED round.<\/em>\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Done early<\/strong>\r\n\r\nResults from Early Decision are typically released in mid-December, and if you are accepted to your dream school, prepare for the best winter break of your high school years. With no homework or applications, you can thoroughly enjoy a well-deserved break. Even if you aren\u2019t accepted Early Decision, you will have your Common App done and potentially some supplements you can recycle for other applications, meaning less work over break. Although I personally didn\u2019t have all my other applications written, I\u2019ve heard of some Early Decision applicants finishing all their applications by the early deadline, so it is possible to have no work over break no matter what your Early Decision result is. Early Decision forces you to start the process earlier, and I personally started writing my Common App in June. This made me less stressed because I was not rushed and had time to edit and change my mind about essay topics.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. More time for transition to college\r\n<\/strong>\r\n\r\nCollege is a big transition, and committing to a college earlier on gives you more time to prepare for the college you will be attending. You will have more time to research special programs, majors and activities so you enter college well-informed. Early Decision also gives you an advantage in the dorm search and roommate search over regular applicants because you can start dorm research earlier and start connecting with other admitted students via Facebook. I have already gotten together with other students from the Bay Area who were also accepted, and I\u2019m also planning to visit in the spring to get a better feel for the campus. Early Decision allows\u00a0me to focus in the spring on the college I\u2019m attending rather than worrying about figuring out where I will attend.\r\n\r\n<strong>4. Decision sooner<\/strong>\r\n\r\nIf you are impatient, the turn-around time of the decision is a major incentive to apply early. The six-week wait from Nov. 1 to Dec. 5\u00a0was long enough. I can't even imagine waiting from early January to the end of March or early April. Even if I had been rejected, I would have liked to know so that I could move on with other applications. If you are not accepted, early decision gives you time to do more research and find another college you would like equally.\r\n\r\n<strong>5. Demonstrated interest<\/strong>\r\n\r\nEveryone who applies Early Decision has the advantage of demonstrated interest. Colleges really like that you are committing to them by applying Early Decision. By applying early, you tell the colleges,\"There's no other school I'd rather be at than yours,\" which means a lot. Colleges like admitting students who are excited to attend their schools and are not applying just because they didn\u2019t get accepted somewhere else. Many schools, including the one I applied to, have been taking an increasing percent of their classes Early Decision, making Regular Decision increasingly competitive.\r\n\r\n<strong>CONS: <\/strong><i>Written by Maddy, who didn't apply ED.<\/i>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_96454\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"305\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/DSC_0125.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-96454\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/DSC_0125.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_0125\" width=\"305\" height=\"458\" \/><\/a> The cons are written by Maddy who decided not to apply Early Decision. Photo by Liana Pickrell.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>1. People change<\/strong>\r\n\r\nHave you ever looked back through old photos or statuses and cringed at what you looked like or said? People change a lot, especially in high school. We\u2019re all growing up and figuring out who we want to be and what we like. Choosing a college is one of the first major life decisions that people make. What you may like now may not be what you\u2019ll like at the end of the year when you\u2019re heading off to college. I have personally changed my mind multiple times throughout my senior year about aspects such as whether I want a small college versus a large college or go to a college near a city versus in a rural area. Be prepared for change.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Not just one great fit<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThere will be many colleges that will be a great fit. I\u2019ve found that even my top colleges often have a couple of points that aren\u2019t ideal in terms of\u00a0what I\u2019m looking for, but overall I like that college. Colleges, like us, aren\u2019t perfect. Setting your heart on just one of those colleges could be detrimental if you don\u2019t get in, but be assured that there is no <i>one <\/i>perfect school. There will be a multitude of colleges and universities where you will be able to flourish and explore. This is one of the reasons that for many, like myself, Early Action is a better path because you don't have to set your mind on a college, but you still get the comfort of hearing back sooner.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Buyer\u2019s remorse<\/strong>\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s imagine that you get in to the school to which\u00a0you apply ED. You\u2019re thrilled, and rightly so. But then April comes around, and your friends and classmates are getting back all their decisions and weighing their options. These conversations may get to you, and you may find yourself with buyer's remorse. As you change over the year, you may start to pick apart your college and have doubts that it's not the perfect place for you. You'll second guess your choice in the absence of options. Personally, I am an indecisive person, and I know that the time in April spent weighing options is going to be important to my college process.\r\n\r\n<strong>4. No senior grades<\/strong>\r\n\r\nOne of the most important aspects of your application that any college counselor or admissions officer will tell you about is your\u00a0transcript. Colleges want to see that you've challenged yourself and that you did well. If you didn\u2019t do well earlier in high school, it may be advantageous to wait to apply Regular Decision so that you can show an upward trend with your first semester senior year grades. Personally, I had a better transcript in my first semester senior year, so it worked out in my favor to wait.\r\n\r\n<strong>5. Less time to write essays<\/strong>\r\n\r\nWith an earlier application due date for Early Decision, there will be more of a crunch to get all of your essays done. Essays are just one component of your application, but they provide a chance for you to talk personally and directly to the admissions directors about the school that you\u2019re applying to. It\u2019s the one aspect of your application process that you have the most control over, so you'll want to make them the best they can be. Many colleges have complex prompts, which from experience I can tell you take longer than you may anticipate. Colleges are looking for thoughtful and well-edited essays, so it may pay off to spend the extra time\u00a0over winter break\u00a0on these supplements.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_96493\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"259\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/ED.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-96493\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/ED.jpg\" alt=\"Photo by George Lu.\" width=\"259\" height=\"163\" \/><\/a> Maddy and Liana contemplate ED. Photo by <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/author\/gelu15\/\">George Lu<\/a>.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<strong>Summary:<\/strong>\r\n\r\nOverall, Early Decision is a personal decision that is right for some and not for others. If you feel confident you\u2019ve found your dream school and that it offers an option to apply Early Decision, then it may be right for you to apply ED. However, if you\u2019re on the fence about your school, then it may make sense to weigh the pros from someone who ended up applying ED and the cons from someone who didn\u2019t.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"As two seniors who've both completed applying to colleges, we, Maddy and Liana, thought that we might pass along some advice to those looking ahead at the college process regarding Early Decision.

According to Associate Supt.\u00a0Charles Young, the survey will be used to make informed decisions about programs the district has already implemented and possibly create new programs. Screenshot by Emily Hwang.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nIn a letter to parents, Supt. Max McGee informed the community about the intent of the surveys.\r\n\r\n\"Working with Hanover Research\u00a0will better enable us to maintain a high degree of accountability to ourselves, our students, and our community, while continuing to offer a rich and challenging academic environment for all students,\" McGee said.\r\n\r\nThe world language\u00a0survey is being taken by students, staff and parents. The student survey focuses on the experiences that high school students have had with language classes throughout their years in the district, including elementary and middle school immersion programs.\r\n\r\nThe district is also looking to see if it should further expand its world language programs, especially at the elementary school level, according to Young.\r\n\r\nThe course\u00a0alignment survey is only administered to students and teachers. The survey inquires about alignment in\u00a0the four core subject areas: math, English, history and science. According to Young, the goal of this study is to understand students\u2019 experiences in their classes around course expectations, assessments and homework.\r\n\r\nAlthough Young says that students with different teachers should have varied experiences within a given course, the district hopes to create a unified experience in the four core classes by outlining the best practices of each course.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe would never want or expect every teacher to do everything exactly the same thing on every given day,\u201d Young said. \u201cWe know that\u2019s not good teaching.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Young, the intent of the surveys is not to criticize staff or students. Rather, the surveys have been developed to continue to reflect on district policies.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe question of alignment experience for students has been an interest that\u2019s been shared in the community for a while,\u201d Young said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about being evaluative or punitive.\u201d\r\n\r\nYoung said that the surveys will surface many strengths that the current curriculum has to offer and also inform the district on how to improve certain policies.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about how we continue to do our work and make it the best experience for our students,\u201d Young said.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto Unified School District is conducting surveys on the world language programs and core subject alignment policies at both Palo Alto High School and Gunn High School.\r\n","date":"2015-04-14 13:04:34","author":"Emily Hwang","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Screen-Shot-2015-03-31-at-8.36.56-PM.png","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"41519":"alignment","41522":"associate superintendent","41523":"charles young","41541":"core","29316":"curriculum","41524":"emilia diaz magaloni","10012":"emily hwang","8674":"english","8752":"gunn high school","41521":"hanover","41528":"hanover research","11617":"history","8771":"homework","41520":"hw","8871":"math","8944":"palo alto high school","8950":"Palo Alto Unified School District","8953":"paly","8972":"parents","8977":"PAUSD","41526":"programs","39964":"research","9072":"science","9111":"social studies","9123":"Staff","9132":"students","11646":"survey","41525":"world language"}},{"id":101737,"title":"Prom checklist: Guys and Girls","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/04\/12\/prom-checklist-guys-and-girls\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_101978\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"800\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Prom-checklist-collage1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-101978\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Prom-checklist-collage1.jpg\" alt=\"Many prom attendees fret about how to prepare for the big dance.

The Paly Voice has compiled a checklist to ensure that each and every one of you has an outstanding prom experience.\r\n\r\n<strong>For Guys<\/strong>\r\n\r\n1. Buy a ticket and bring your student ID \u2014 Your Prom experience will be severely limited without one of these.\r\n\r\n2. Hygiene \u2014 You don\u2019t want any residue from last week\u2019s party stopping you from getting into Prom. Good hygiene also comes with other perks such as friends who won't be repulsed if your breath smells like the Cheesehouse sandwich that you ate for lunch three days ago.\r\n\r\n3. Get a date \u2014 Going stag is cool, but it's kind of hard to slow dance by yourself.\r\n\r\n4. Rent or buy a tux \u2014 Good news: Nobody is going to kill you if you are wearing a similar tux as another guy. Bad news: It can\u2019t be your dad\u2019s from 30 years ago. Rent or buy your own, and get it professionally fitted.\r\n\r\n5. Pick up your date\u2019s corsage \u2014 This is mandatory \u2013 your date will love flowers.\r\n\r\n6. Get a haircut \u2014 Don\u2019t go to Prom with bedhead. Your date will notice the difference after spending so many hours perfecting their own hair.\r\n\r\n7. Eat a good breakfast \u2014 Every good day starts with a killer breakfast. This is a good day, and by the transitive property, you need a good breakfast.\r\n\r\n8. Have fun \u2014 This is a once or twice in a lifetime event for most \u2013 live in the moment and let loose. Enjoy having a blast with your friends, your class and your date. Prom is just as much as you make of it.\r\n\r\n<strong>For Girls<\/strong>\r\n\r\n1. Buy a ticket \u2014 Buy your own. It isn't the 1920s anymore.\r\n\r\n2. Bring an ID \u2014 Or else you won\u2019t be allowed on the bus. So really don\u2019t forget your ID.\r\n\r\n3. Use alcohol free mouthwash \u2014Don\u2019t be that person who doesn\u2019t pass the breathalyzer test.\r\n\r\n4. Get your dress hemmed and properly tailored\u2014 Unless you are blessed with perfect, model-esque proportions, you will need to get your dress hemmed and tailored. You don\u2019t want to be tripping over your dress at Prom. Also, book early so the tailor can ensure it will be done by Prom.\r\n\r\n5. Buy a boutonniere \u2014 Boutonnieres really sharpen up your guy\u2019s tux. Reserve a boutonniere that you can pick up the day of Prom so it is nice and fresh \u2013 you don\u2019t want the petals to fall off.\r\n\r\n6. Bring flats or prepare to go barefoot \u2014 Heels hurt. I thought I got \u201ccomfortable\u201d heels last year. The lesson I learned: There are no such things as comfortable heels after three hours of dancing.\r\n\r\n7. Eat something before you go \u2014 The bus ride takes a while. Don\u2019t starve yourself the day before thinking you will look better in your dress. You will be really tired and won\u2019t enjoy the night as much.\r\n\r\n8. Have fun \u2014 This is the most important one. Prom is a blast, whether you\u2019re going with your a date or stag. Enjoy everything from getting your hair done to picking shoes to taking photos and relishing the night itself.","excerpt":"Sports editor Liana Pickrell and staffer Christian Leong have created a Prom guide for guys and girls on how to successfully prepare leading up to the big dance.

She told The Paly Voice in an email last evening that\u00a0she is now resting at home and will return to teaching after spring break.\r\n\r\nAccording to witness sophomore Jessica Wong, an explosion occurred during 3rd Period while Paymer\u00a0was finishing up a gas law property demonstration with flammable liquid methane. Some backpacks and papers were damaged, but no students were hospitalized after the fire.\r\n\r\nPAFD Battalion Chief Kevin McNally said that though\u00a0PAFD is in the process of investigating the matter, there may not have been enough smoke in the room to trigger the fire alarm.\r\n\r\n\"It was not a sustained fire,\" McNally said. \"I can speculate that the alarm didn't go off because most of them are smoke detectors, not flame detectors. Unless there's enough smoke produced to\u00a0actually set the alarm off, it won't go off.\"\r\n\r\nWong noted her concern about the apparent fire alarm malfunction.\r\n\r\n\"I was pretty shocked that there had been a literal fiery explosion and the alarm didn\u2019t even go off,\" Wong said. \"There was definitely smoke in the room.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Wong, Paymer\u00a0immediately used the emergency shower, a feature that is installed in every science classroom, to put out the flames on her\u00a0body, and students poured water onto burning items in the room.\r\n\r\n\"It [the fire extinguisher] didn\u2019t get used,\" Wong said. \"I think it\u2019s because all the fires were so small and spread out.\"\r\n\r\nSophomore Jordan Quigley, who was also in the classroom at the time of the fire, said that Paymer\u00a0told a group of students to get help\u00a0from science teacher Ron Bowditch in the room next door. Bowditch then called the paramedics and school personnel.\r\n\r\n\"Paymer\u00a0was pretty calm for what had happened,\" Quigley said.\r\n\r\nAccording to sophomore Aman Mittal, another witness to the explosion, the methane used in the experiment was supposed to spark a flame to propel a plastic container backward. Mittal noted that the experiment failed multiple times and suddenly erupted into flames on the final attempt.\r\n\r\n\"She [Paymer] was working with methane in an empty milk carton to make a reaction happen, but it wouldn't work,\" Mittal said. \"So she kept trying, and I guess all the methane from the previous tries reacted, as in caught fire, and the entire front of the room burst into flames for a split second.\"\r\n\r\nWong said that\u00a0the students were grateful that Paymer\u00a0reacted quickly to the incident.\r\n\r\n\"We\u2019re so lucky that it [the whole classroom] didn't catch on fire and [that] no one else got hurt \u2013 not even people sitting in the front row,\" Wong said.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto Fire Department and Palo Alto High School administration are investigating why a classroom fire alarm failed to go off after a chemistry demonstration yesterday ignited a fire that injured a teacher.","date":"2015-04-02 18:24:55","author":"Lizzie Chun","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/IMG_22931.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"8453":"accident","41255":"aman mittal","41249":"burn","41250":"chem","11624":"chemistry","41252":"experiment","33669":"fire","10447":"fire alarm","41531":"fire department","41253":"jessica wong","41254":"jordan quigley","41529":"kevin mcnally","41530":"pafd","8944":"palo alto high school","8953":"paly","41251":"recovery","41287":"silja paymer","9150":"Teacher"}},{"id":101643,"title":"InFocus travels to SoCal","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/03\/31\/infocus-travels-to-socal\/","content":"&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_75011\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"563\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/MG_55571.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-75011\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/09\/MG_55571.jpg\" alt=\"INfocus Network and Viking Magazine adviser Paul Hoeprich gives students tips on how to take great videos.

On Friday at the Mitchell Park Community Center, Palo\u00a0Alto teens and adults came together for a youth forum\u00a0to encourage\u00a0teenagers\u00a0to have open discussion in a safe environment.\r\n\r\nTeen-selected adult facilitators and students from the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.cityofpaloalto.org\/gov\/depts\/csd\/recreation\/teens\/leadership.aspand\">Teen Advisory Board<\/a>\u00a0and <a href=\"https:\/\/paloaltoyouthcouncil.wordpress.com\/\">Palo Alto Youth Council<\/a>\u00a0led the event, officially titled \u201cIn This Together: A Place to Share, A Place to Support, A Place to Heal.\u201d The two teen groups seek to improve the community by linking teens with\u00a0the general public through the implementation of\u00a0programs that encourage student involvement.\r\n\r\n\u201c[The] teen voice is really important,\u201d TAB and\u00a0PAYC\u00a0member Elinor Aspegren said. \u201cTeens are often told that their opinions don\u2019t matter or that they\u2019re too young to know what they\u2019re talking about. \u2026 And right now, we\u2019ve given them a space to talk about what they\u2019re feeling.\u201d\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"\/\/www.cincopa.com\/media-platform\/iframe.aspx?fid=A4LAdZsnM7_z\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\nThe event kicked off with a few introductory remarks from Aspegren,\u00a0Gunn High School junior\u00a0and master of ceremonies; Rob de Geus, Palo Alto director of community services; and Amal Aziz, youth and teen services director of The City of Palo Alto.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must be intentional [and] authentic and show resolve in our discussion with teens as we go forward,\u201d de Geus said.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, students and adults split into their respective sessions: teen discussion circles and an adult support workshop. Students engaged in three rounds of 25-minute dialogue circles, which covered the topics of \u201cSocial Academic Pressure,\u201d \u201cGrieving, Coping and Dealing with Loss,\u201d \u201cDealing with Stress,\u201d \u201cDefeating Stigma,\u201d \u201cDealing with Depression\u201d and \u201cInclusion, Acceptance and Friendship.\u201d The dialogue circles prompted students to reflect on their own lives in order to offer suggestions for how to improve the community in the future.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt [the forum] gets the conversation going, and that doesn\u2019t happen very much in other circumstances,\u201d Gunn junior Rachel Gates said.\r\n\r\nStudent facilitator and Palo Alto High School senior Emma Chiu and adult facilitator and\u00a0Gunn Oracle adviser Kristy Blackburn led the \u201cSocial Academic Pressure\u201d dialogue circle. Students discussed where academic pressure stems from and how students and adults can change the definition of social academic pressure within Palo Alto. Ideas ranged from not limiting the number of Advanced Placement classes a student can take to counting a smaller achievement, such as winning a video game,\u00a0as a success.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cDealing with Stress\u201d group led by adult facilitator Eric Bloom, Paly\u00a0Social Studies\u00a0and school climate teacher, discussed the causes of stress, how it feels and ways to alleviate it. Some members of the group reported that\u00a0tests, relationships and the future often make them feel hot, tense and filled with nervous energy.\r\n\r\nThe dialogue circles gave students chances\u00a0to be heard and to hear others, according to de Geus.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo listen and to understand can be a very powerful thing,\u201d de Geus said.\r\n\r\nAfter each dialogue session was complete,\u00a0students and adults met during \"Empathy Hour\" to allow facilitators to summarize their discussions with the rest of the forum attendees.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that when we come back and talk about all the things said in the circles, parents and administrators will \u2026 start to realize what teens and adults want,\u201d Aspegren said.\r\n\r\nGates enjoyed the experience to both share and listen to the\u00a0teen attendee's\u00a0ideas.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was a nice to see a lot of different people engaging with each other and hearing different perspectives from people of different parts of the community,\u201d Gates said.\r\n\r\nAccording to Aspegren, the \"In This Together\" forum is just one of many discussions that will begin to\u00a0make a strong connection\u00a0between adults and teens in the community.\r\n\r\n\u201cSome say teenagers are too young \u2026 to make decisions, but I think teenagers have the power to change the world,\u201d Gunn sophomore and TAB\u00a0member Shannon Yang said.","excerpt":"Both teens and adults came together to discuss how to improve community wellbeing and mental health in the City of Palo Alto at a youth forum on Friday at the Mitchell Park Community Center.","date":"2015-03-29 20:34:35","author":"Adele Bloch","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/IMG_8770.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"8611":"Community","41053":"elinor aspegren","11240":"emma chiu","11236":"eric bloom","18368":"forum","8751":"gunn","41054":"kristy blackburn","37655":"mental health","27709":"mitchell park","8939":"palo alto","8944":"palo alto high school","41052":"palo alto youth council","8953":"paly","28786":"payc","41056":"rachel gates","41057":"rob de geus","41055":"shannon yang","9107":"slideshow","9129":"student","39961":"student forum","41051":"tab","27177":"teen","33698":"teen advisory board","40993":"teen forum"}}]
