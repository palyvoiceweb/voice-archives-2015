The goal of these efforts is to send a simple message to the entire Paly community: \"We're here for you,\"\u00a0Principal Kim Diorio said.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most innovative support tool made available to students is a\u00a0new email communication service, which Diorio introduced in a letter sent out to the entire Paly community Monday night. Students can use\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:palysupport@pausd.org\">palysupport@pausd.org<\/a>\u00a0to refer friends that they think are in need of professional assistance, or to write out their own thoughts and feelings and receive support.\r\n\r\n\"We need our students to tell us when they're concerned about a friend,\" Diorio said. \"When students are able to talk to us or tell us that they're worried about somebody, we can help.\"\r\n\r\nDiorio also emphasized the importance of communication among community members, including parents and students,\u00a0and encouraged\u00a0students\u00a0to seek help from adults and friends when necessary.\r\n\r\n\"Like most families, we unconditionally love each other,\" Diorio wrote in the letter. \"What unites us and makes us a family is our unconditional love of our students.\"\r\n\r\nThe school's\u00a0immediate response\u00a0to the events on Monday morning included a crisis response team, which consisted of Paly guidance counselors and\u00a0counselors from external agencies such as <a href=\"www.kara-grief.org\" target=\"_blank\">Kara<\/a>\u00a0and <a href=\"www.acs-teens.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Adolescent Counseling Services<\/a>.

The Unity Club hosted a \"safe zone\" during Lunch earlier today. Diorio attended the event, along with several other Paly faculty members.\r\n\r\n\"We want to give students a space to talk about what's going because we know suicide is a conversation that is very hard to start,\" junior Unity Club vice president Siggi Bengston said. \"The main message we want to get across to Paly is we need change. There have been too many young lives lost in just this past school year, and it's time for something different.\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to addressing\u00a0student welfare, Diorio also noted that the administration is making\u00a0a great effort to reach out and provide support to teachers. Eight substitute teachers were available on Monday and Tuesday to step into class to allow teachers to take a break. A school\u00a0psychologist assisted the classes in which the deceased student was enrolled, according to Diorio.\r\n\r\n\"We've been keeping our pulse on how the teachers are doing and coping, and making sure they have the support and counseling that they might need,\" Diorio said.\r\n\r\nSeveral Paly parents were also invited to campus this week to engage in conversation with students and remind them of the counseling resources available.\r\n\r\n\"We have parents on campus ...\u00a0helping suggest that students go\u00a0talk to adults up in the guidance area or counselors if they need that support,\" Diorio said.\r\n\r\nDiorio hopes to further engage parents in the conversation and plans to host parent events in the future. Among these events include an open house Coffee with Paly administrators earlier this\u00a0morning, hosted by the Parent Teacher Student Association, where parents were encouraged to come talk in an informal environment.\r\n\r\n\"We know that they [parents] are concerned,\u00a0want to help out and want to talk,\" Diorio said.\r\n\r\nDiorio reiterated the main message\u00a0that the community is here to support\u00a0everyone.\r\n\r\n\"If you need support or help, please talk with any of your teachers, your teacher adviser or any staff member you see wandering about,\" Diorio wrote. \"We're here for you.\"\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>A list of school and community resources are available on the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/paly.net\/crisis-resources\" target=\"_blank\">Paly website Crisis Resources page<\/a>\u00a0and the <a href=\"http:\/\/pausd.org\/parents\/services\/counseling\/\" target=\"_blank\">PAUSD\u00a0Counseling Services page<\/a>.

Participants will experience life in a rural community in a Latin American country over a three-week period in the summer and will engage\u00a0in a variety of community service activities.\r\n\r\n\"Students will travel to a small city in Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic or Ecuador and will stay in a hostel for two to three weeks,\" Foug said. \"They'll teach English to the locals in the evenings for free and work on a community action project.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the goals of the program is to\u00a0expose students to the realities of life in other parts of the world.\r\n\r\n\"They'll spend a day with the [local] families and see what it's like to live on a dollar a day,\" Foug said.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_100776\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"397\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/11051015_803181706441324_1325225690_n.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-100776\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/11051015_803181706441324_1325225690_n.jpg\" alt=\"From left: Juniors Rebecca Sunner\u00e5s Jonsson, Claire Krugler and Eli Craveiro Frankel, all participants in the Global Glimpse program, set up a bake sale in downtown Palo Alto.

There are a lot of talented players in all the grades, and they know how to get back to the CCS finals.\"\r\n\r\nLu\u00a0noted the potential for success in the young team but added that the loss of key senior players will greatly impact the Vikings\u00a0next season.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe team will still be pretty strong [next season], but since the seniors from this year were a solid part of the team, it may take some time getting used to playing with different people in different positions,\" Lu said.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"A 3-2 defeat to rival Mountain View High School (18-3-1, 10-1-1) in the Central Coast Section championship game over the weekend ended a strong 2014-15 season for the Palo Alto High School girls' soccer team (16-3-1, 9-2-1), which finished behind Mountain View in both CCS and the De Anza Division of the Santa Clara Valley Athletic League.","date":"2015-03-11 20:43:02","author":"Saba Moussavian","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/MG_24611.jpg","categories":["Sports","Spotlight"],"tags":{"40617":"alison lu","8568":"CCS","8634":"de anza league","10172":"finals","10198":"girls soccer","18382":"loss","8944":"palo alto high school","8953":"paly","9032":"recap","40197":"sarah lim","32750":"season recap","9110":"Soccer"}},{"id":97578,"title":"&#8220;A Day in the Life&#8221;: Paly Choirs to release album","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/03\/10\/a-day-in-the-life-paly-choirs-to-release-album\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_98646\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"620\"]<img class=\"wp-image-98646\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/10984814_1065924916766590_1961063480_n.jpg\" alt=\"Palo Alto High School's all-male accapella group, the Heart Breakers (left to right: sophomore Spencer Wycoff, junior Sean Jawetz, senior Grant Smith, senior Edward Kwiatkowski) perform at the Pops Concert on Feb. 11.

Photo by Alex Merkle-Raymond.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Palo Alto High School Theatre Department\u00a0brings song and laughter on stage with a new musical comedy set in the 1920s. \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/11\/16\/spring-musical-auditions-not-to-be-slept-through\/\">The Drowsy Chaperone<\/a>,\u201d which premiered Friday, exceeds expectations by\u00a0causing\u00a0the audience to laugh out loud throughout the performance, giving the audience members a good run for their money.\r\n\r\nThe story revolves around The Man in the Chair, played by senior Oskar Soderberg, and his bizarre obsession with Broadway musicals. One night, as he plays a record of the musical \u201cThe Drowsy Chaperone,\u201d the characters come to life and transform his apartment into a dazzling Broadway stage.\u00a0As\u00a0the musical progresses, the Man in the Chair continuously interrupts the performance to give comedic commentary about each scene.\r\n\r\nThe musical stars senior\u00a0Cara Kienitz as Janet Van de Graaff, an actress engaged to businessman Robert Martin, played by senior Will Kast. On the couple's wedding day, a series of events staged by multiple characters interrupts the proceedings and threatens to prevent the two from marrying. Producer Feldzieg, played by senior Ido Gal, is threatened by gangsters disguised as pastry chefs, played by junior Paul Bleich and senior Lizzy\u00a0McCole, to prevent the marriage as it will result in the loss of his show's\u00a0leading lady. While fending off attempts from airhead Kitty, played by sophomore Alia Cuadros-Contreras, to become the leading lady, Feldzieg convinces \"Latin Lover\" Adolpho, played by junior Ophir Sneh, to seduce the bride. However, Aldolpho mistakes Janet for her chaperone and hilarity ensues.\r\n\r\nThe groom is not supposed to see the bride on the wedding day, and so the task falls to the Drowsy Chaperone, played by junior Adele Bloch, with her constant drunkenness and hilarious input, to keep the lovebirds away from each other. The groom, convinced by his best man, George, played by sophomore Jackson Kienitz, that the best way to relax is to meander in roller skates with a blindfold so as not to see his bride on the wedding day, provides comic relief with his roller skating attempts. Each of the individual plots, including a comedic dialogue between the butler, played by sophomore Jason Pollak,\u00a0and hostess Mrs. Tottendale, played by senior Jamie Garcia,\u00a0intertwines into an amusing play that is made even more interesting by the Man in the Chair\u2019s input.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_100838\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"509\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/DSC_2182-800x534.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-100838\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/DSC_2182-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_2182 (800x534)\" width=\"509\" height=\"340\" \/><\/a> Two gangsters disguised as pastry chefs, played by junior Paul Bleich and senior Lizzy McCole, provide the play with drama and comic relief. Photo by Alex Merkle-Raymond.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Drowsy Chaperone\u201d uses\u00a0creative props and costumes, both of which\u00a0establish the extravagant setting and transport the audience to the 1920s. The play employs various set pieces that\u00a0allow actors to efficiently alternate between the jazz age and present day\u00a0without confusion. The alternating eras also allow the Man in the Chair to relay amusing critiques about the musical\u2019s faults as well as general opinions about individual actors. This breaking of the fourth wall positively affects the performance as it provides entertainment and helps the audience connect with the Man in the Chair.\r\n\r\nThe music from the Paly Band was on point with all of the character\u2019s actions, and the transitions between pieces were flawless. The music never drowned out the characters\u2019 singing and brought to life the play\u2019s upbeat tone. The mood\u00a0and plot of the play never faltered, and the play\u2019s hour and a half\u00a0length did little to bore the audience. The lighting was also well in-tune with the actors\u2019 actions, especially in one scene in which the flashing lights emphasize Janet Van de Graaff\u2019s emotions as she suffers a mental breakdown.\r\n\r\nAll of the actors did a wonderful job of portraying their characters. Bloch\u2019s portrayal of the Drowsy Chaperone was very well acted with her swaying movements and the constant presence of a martini glass. The Chaperone\u2019s cynical, yet funny view on life provided an interesting contrast to the other characters\u2019 optimistic outlooks. Kienitz made a wonderfully glamorous actress, while Gal\u2019s performance of Feldzieg greatly\u00a0illustrated the desperate producer\u2019s frustrations. The gangsters\u2019 food puns were as amusingly ridiculous as their costumes, and Sneh\u2019s dramatic swishing of his cape and cane during his portrayal of Aldolpho provided a good laugh. Soderberg\u2019s insightful and sometimes moving commentary as the Man in the Chair showed to the audience that the play is wonderful because it is so ridiculous.\r\n\r\nHowever, audience members may need to pay extra attention to some characters with heavier accents. The actors sang skillfully\u00a0as their voices remained pleasant and in tune. The few dance routines added a flair to the musical aspect of the play, and Will\u00a0Kast and Jackson Kienitz\u00a0even broke out tap dancing.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Drowsy Chaperone\u201d invokes a constant stream of laughter from the audience, making it a memorable and lighthearted experience. The absurd, yet lovable cast of characters along with the music and jokes makes the\u00a0musical\u00a0a must-see. The play's hilarious script and actors' performances\u00a0ensure that the audience will be laughing by the end of the night.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Drowsy Chaperone\u201d has three more shows this week on Thursday, March 12; Friday, March 13; and Saturday, March 14. All shows start at 7:30 p.m. in the Haymarket\u00a0Theater. Tickets are $10 for students and seniors and $15 for adults.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School Theater brings singing and laughter onto stage with a new musical comedy set in the 1920s.","date":"2015-03-09 22:18:08","author":"Aidan Maese-Czeropski","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/DSC_2285-800x534.jpg","categories":["A&amp;E Section Spotlight","Reviews","Spotlight"],"tags":{"40211":"broadway","19628":"musical","8944":"palo alto high school","8953":"paly","18258":"paly theatre","11878":"performance","8996":"play","40229":"spring musical","40210":"the drowsy chaperone","9160":"theatre"}},{"id":100853,"title":"Season preview: Track and field team faces new hurdles","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/03\/09\/season-preview-track-and-field-team-faces-new-hurdles\/","content":"Despite losing key\u00a0runners, the Palo Alto High School track and field team is looking to expand on its achievements last year with young potential and a set of new coaches.\r\n\r\nLast year, the Paly boys finished fifth in the De Anza league (2-4), and the Paly girls finished third (4-2).
