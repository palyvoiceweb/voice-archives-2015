The goal of Sushirrito is to blend\u00a0\"the premium flavors and healthiness of sushi with the form factor and convenience of burritos,\" according to its\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.sushirrito.com\/food\/\">website<\/a>.\r\n\r\nThe store is set up with the order station towards the back of the restaurant. The counter looks similar to Chipotle with little buckets off toppings, but few substitutions are allowed. The sushi is made to order and is prepared quickly, right in front of you.\r\n\r\nThe rolls are generous and packed with Asian-inspired ingredients like lotus chips, red tobiko, wasabi dust and tempura flakes. The rolls vary in price from $9 to $13 depending on the ingredients used.\r\n\r\nThe roll is much larger than the average restaurant roll sushi but is still relatively expensive for just one food item. The vegetarian rolls\u00a0($9) seem like a better deal than some of the more extravagant options.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_96314\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/IMG_4838.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-96314\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/IMG_4838.jpg\" alt=\"The Geisha's Kiss ($12) is the most popular sushi roll on the menu.

Food trends come in waves, like the C.R.E.A.M obsession, and\u00a0Sushirrito seems to have found the ideal fad location, just two stores down from C.R.E.A.M.. Maybe this\u00a0delicious, fresh roll will stay in Palo Alto longer than other trendy food stores.\r\n\r\nWith Sushirrito in the heart of downtown and an easy to-go meal, students are very excited about its arrival.\r\n\r\n\"I would say it's quite delicious,\" senior Daryl Dillahunty said. \"It's definitely more filling than just getting a normal roll of sushi. I felt like everything tasted really fresh and good and it's pretty fast service. Overall a wonderful establishment.\"\r\n\r\nSushirrito is open from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. every day.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"Sushirrito opened in downtown Palo Alto last Saturday featuring fresh food on the go.
