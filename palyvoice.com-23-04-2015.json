Each year, the event attracts more and more participants, and there are more volunteer organizations\u00a0present than ever before.\r\n\r\nStudents who have not already signed up to\u00a0volunteer at off-campus organizations are instead encouraged to participate in the available on-campus activities during lunch. Clubs and organizations will be on campus raising awareness for their respective causes and providing volunteer opportunities to students. No sign-ups are required, and free pizza will be served to those who participate in two or more activities.\r\n\r\n\"It is our hope that the students who participate in Service Day are able to find new ways to express their passions, find new ways to be involved and engaged in their communities, and find places where they can try new things,\" Wang said. \"Volunteering is a great way to get a feel for different career paths without heavy commitment for sacrifices.\"\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"overflow-y:hidden;\" src=\"https:\/\/magic.piktochart.com\/embed\/5660368-paly-service-day-2015\" width=\"620\" height=\"1183\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\nOrganizing this event took a large number of people, and Wang is grateful for the support and efforts of everyone\u00a0involved.\r\n\r\n\"This year, it was an incredible team effort,\" Wang said. \"More people have chipped in than ever before.

Photo by Jeanette Wong.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nOver 40 Gunn High School students attended the Palo Alto Unified School District Board of Education meeting tonight to contest the district\u2019s decision to remove Gunn\u2019s academic Zero Period classes.\r\n\r\nThe students went to the meeting in response to a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.paloaltoonline.com\/media\/reports\/1428767898.pdf\">letter from Supt. Max McGee<\/a> in which he announced that Gunn will no longer be offering Zero Period classes after this year, other than non-academic courses such as Physical Education.\r\n\r\nOut of the 24 people who signed up to talk during the open forum portion of the meeting, 17 Gunn students spoke, all arguing in favor of keeping Zero Period as a choice for students.\r\n\r\nThe students emphasized repeatedly that the decision was made without student input, there was a lack of data supporting claims against Zero Period and that reducing students\u2019 choices will not decrease their stress.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s about student voice,\u201d Gunn sophomore Mihir Juvvadi said to the board members. \u201cThe key is that we want a proper process to be followed in all future decisions. \u2026 You made a decision about the schedule without consulting students. You didn\u2019t hear us talk; you heard us talk after you had made your decision. We thank you for hearing our voices, but when it did come, it was a little bit too late.\u201d\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_102498\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"309\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/DSC_4212.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-102498\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/DSC_4212.jpg\" alt=\"Gunn sophomore Natalie Rozak speaks to the board members. &quot;Our voice matters,&quot; Rozak said. &quot;Please stop putting words into our mouths.&quot; Photo by Jeanette Wong\" width=\"309\" height=\"207\" \/><\/a> Gunn sophomore Natalie Rozak speaks to the board members. \"Our voice matters,\" Rozak said. \"Please stop putting words into our mouths.\" Photo by Jeanette Wong[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAccording to the speakers, one of the main issues regarding this decision is the lack of communication between the board and students. Although the board did attempt to connect with students, according to some students, some felt that it would have been more effective for administration and students to reach a resolution together, after discussions with all relevant members of the community.\r\n\r\nIn an opening statement, McGee expressed regret that students did not feel they were adequately involved in decision-making regarding this issue.\r\n\r\n\u201cI understand the frustration, the anger and the disappointment of our students and our faculty who want to retain the current practice,\u201d McGee said. \u201cI am very sorry that we did not do our best job in this instance.\u201d\r\n\r\nGunn School Board Representative Rose Weinmann called the decision \u201cmisguided paternalism\u201d and not in the best interest of Gunn students.\r\n\r\nHeather Schultz, a parent of a current Gunn High School student, spoke during the open forum to voice her support for the choice that Zero Period offers students.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am concerned about change simply for the sake of change itself,\u201d Schultz said. \u201cIt [the decision] feels rushed and dismissive of student opinions.\u201d\r\n\r\nGunn Sophomore Class President Chloe Chang Sorenson confronted the board members about the adverse consequences that removing Zero Period could prompt.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou do not see that your \u2018positive changes\u2019 are actually increasing stress in many students and making us feel powerless and overwhelmed,\u201d Chang said. \u201cIt\u2019s an endless cycle that always repeats again and again and again, and students always end up on the bottom.\u201d\r\n\r\nSome students urged the board to actively respond to the voice of the students now.\r\n\r\n\u201cStudents\u2019 faith in the school board is very closely tied with this decision,\u201d Gunn Senior Class President Mack Radin said. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to say you\u2019ll listen to us in the future, but it would be so powerful to listen to us now, if you change something now.\u201d\r\n\r\nVarious student speakers gave accounts of their personal experiences with Zero Period, and claimed that it has helped them to manage their time more effectively.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am taking zero period so I can choose to have more control over my schedule,\u201d sophomore Lucy Augustine said.\r\n\r\nSophomore Natalie Rozak shared her disappointment last year when her schedule did not allow her to fully pursue her passion of horseback riding. However, she has modified her schedule this year to include a Zero Period class, which she says better fits her personal needs.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_102499\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"274\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/DSC_4194.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-102499\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/DSC_4194.jpg\" alt=\"Superintendent Max McGee speaks out to members of the PAUSD community and acknowledges their feelings. \u201cI understand the frustration, the anger and the disappointment of our students and our faculty who want to retain the current practice,\u201d McGee said. \u201cI am very sorry that we did not do our best job in this instance.\u201d Photo by Jeanette Wong.\" width=\"274\" height=\"184\" \/><\/a> Superintendent Max McGee speaks out to members of the PAUSD community. \u201cI understand the frustration, the anger and the disappointment of our students and our faculty who want to retain the current practice,\u201d McGee said. \u201cI am very sorry that we did not do our best job in this instance.\u201d Photo by Jeanette Wong.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause of Zero Period, I am able to ride horses every single day and complete my homework on time,\u201d Rozak said.\r\n\r\nFollowing the meeting, some students said they were disappointed that there was no discussion of revisiting the elimination of academic classes during zero period. Gunn Associated Student Body President Aren Raisinghani recognizes this disappointment, but acknowledges the difficulties in achieving immediate change on such a large scale.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere was over an hour of talking \u2026 but even with all the different forms of persuasion, still no action was taken \u2014 or discussed being taken \u2014 at the executive level,\u201d Raisinghani said. \u201cMany students are frustrated because they came here today with that [a promise to revisit the new policy] in mind... [However,] I wouldn\u2019t expect the School Board to take action immediately following a school board meeting because, in any leadership group, there are a lot of formalities.\u201d\r\n\r\nSeveral students expressed gratitude for the action taken by the community, and assistance in helping make school a better place.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe really, really appreciate your concern and the concern of the parents in the community,\u201d Gunn sophomore Olivia Ellson said. \u201cWe recognize the good intentions, and we understand that after the tragedies of this year, there is a need to take action. Whatever you decide to do with all of the discussion today, we would like you to know that we are a community. We know that Gunn can be stressful, and we would like to work with you to change that.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe need your support, your time and an open mind,\u201d Sorensen said. \u201cShow us that we\u2019re all in this together.\u201d","excerpt":"Over 40 Gunn High School students attended the Palo Alto Unified School District Board of Education meeting tonight to contest the district\u2019s decision to remove Gunn\u2019s academic Zero Period classes.","date":"2015-04-22 00:09:11","author":"Emily Hwang","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/this-one.jpg","categories":["Editor's Pick","News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"11799":"Board of Education","42272":"district office","8752":"gunn high school","32445":"max mcgee","42271":"palo alto unified","8953":"paly","8977":"PAUSD","42274":"removal","9069":"School Board","11606":"superintendent","42273":"zero period"}},{"id":102347,"title":"Paly debaters prevail at tournament","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/04\/20\/paly-debaters-prevail-at-tournament\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_102348\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"387\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Screen-Shot-2015-04-17-at-10.11.45-PM.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-102348\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/Screen-Shot-2015-04-17-at-10.11.45-PM.png\" alt=\"Juniors Anna Lu and Anna Nakai pose for a picture after co-championing in the varsity division at the Santa Clara Philalethic Invitational tournament.

The theme of this day is to bring awareness to stereotypes embedded in \u201cisms,\u201d such as sexism and racism, and learn to \u201cerase\u201d them. Brunch will include a chalk walk activity.

Service Day allows students to participate in various volunteer activities both on campus during lunch and around the Bay Area. Students will volunteer at\u00a0over 40 different off-campus sites, aiding causes that include the environment, the arts, poverty, homelessness, health and safety and more. The off-campus site signups are now closed, but students can still participate in the many service projects available for students during lunch.\r\n\r\nService Day also marks the end of the food drive for Neighbors Helping Neighbors, a local organization that provides food for families unable to qualify for other \u201csafety net\u201d programs.

Then they must research the country and its position, write the position paper and go to the conferences to debate and find a solution.\r\n\r\n\u201cOnce we find our solution we have to work together with the other countries to write and pass a resolution,\u201d Frankel said. \u201cIt is a really fun and interesting experience.\u201d\r\n\r\nFrankel said that some topics that the club has seen this year were Israel vs Palestine, cyber warfare, maritime piracy, and the Syrian Civil War.\r\n\r\nAccording to Frankel, so far this year Model UN has attended the Intergenerational Model United Nations Conference in San Francisco, Stanford Model United Nations Conference, Santa Clara Valley Model United Nations Conference at Santa Teresa High School in San Jos\u00e9, and Berkeley Model United Nations Conference at UC Berkeley.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe conferences we attend, especially Berkeley Model UN Conference and Stanford Model UN Conference, are attended by people from all over the world, and as you can imagine, a bunch of really put-together people in suits can be really intimidating,\u201d Ahmad said. \u201cA big part of being successful at conferences is being confident in your solutions and research, even if you're completely making something up.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Ahmad, in order to give the club the opportunity to get comfortable debating and discussing within parliamentary procedure, the leadership team implemented mock conferences for club members.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis year I think the biggest change we implemented was hosting mock conferences,\u201d Ahmad said. \u201cWe decided to do these so that our members would be more prepared for actual conferences and the style of debating you do there.\u201d\r\n\r\nMany members of the club won awards at these conferences for excellent research and in-committee skills, including junior Chris van Gelder (3 times), sophomore Gaby Pelayo, sophomore Joelle Dong, sophomore Zahra Muzaffar, and more, according to Frankel.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis year has been an amazing year for the club as we have grown significantly to include more members,\u201d Frankel said. In addition, we have improved how the clubs works and learns thanks to our amazing president Zofia Ahmad, our wonderful secretary sophomore Mary McNamara, our terrific treasurer Alicia Mies, and our two awesome advisors, history teachers Mr. Grant Blackburn and Mr. Christopher Farina.\u201d\r\n\r\nPaly MUN meets every Monday in room 813 during lunch.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe hope to continue improving our club next year and create more amazing MUN experiences,\u201d Frankel said.\r\n<p style=\"color: #000000;\"><em>Editor\u2019s note: This version of the story correctly states that Model United Nations club has been at Paly for over four years.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>","excerpt":"Although Palo Alto High School's Model United Nations club has been around for four years, quite a few Paly students are unaware of what the club is actually about.
