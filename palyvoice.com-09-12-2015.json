So I started bookmarking pages, collecting ideas and making spreadsheets of places with the intention of one day being able to do this.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Chute had\u00a0been pondering the idea to host such a program for a while, it was an experience in Spain that\u00a0ignited the\u00a0idea in its entirety.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThis has been a very long time in the making for me, probably a decade or so,\u201d Chute said. \u201cI\u2019ve traveled a lot, and every now and then I have these moments when it all comes together. When I was in Barcelona and I was touring the Sagrada Familia [a famous church], I saw this magic square, which is an array of numbers where they all add to the same number in every direction. The numbers all added to 33, which was the year Christ was when he died. That was just amazing, just out of nowhere there it was. For me, that was the moment when my project was born.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Chute, the trip will happen over the spring break of 2016 and is set to include visits to France and England. \u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cWe will be in London and Paris for three or four days each,\u201d Chute said. \u201cWhen we are in London, we will be taking trips out to Bletchley Park and Hampton Court Palace.\u201d\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chute said she chose London and Paris because there were many mathematical\u00a0experiences available and because it was easier to plan a trip to countries that are geographically adjacent. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many students are eager to signup because of the unique experience offered. Sophomore Edward Kim expressed his interest in the program and the opportunity to learn math in another country. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI wanted a change from the usual lecture-based format of school, so a hands-on exhibit of certain mathematical concepts would be a refreshing alternative from sitting at a desk and taking notes,\u201d Kim said. \u201cI went to Spain on an educational school trip to learn Spanish a few years ago, and experiencing a new continent with entirely different customs was a life-changing experience. Not only that, but my Spanish has improved in leaps and bounds.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nChute said that scholarships will most\u00a0likely not be offered as there is no outside funding for the trip. However, she\u00a0hopes\u00a0that scholarships can\u00a0be offered in future year's trips.\r\n\r\nChute also hopes to\u00a0create\u00a0a club for students that teaches\u00a0the\u00a0math behind many historical features, regardless of whether students want to go to Europe.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cMy vision is to form a \u2018Math in Europe\u2019 club which anyone can join, trip member or not,\u201d Chute said. \u201cI want to look at the things that we will be seeing and the mathematics behind them in a fun, eye-opening and exploratory way.\u201d <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The opportunity to go on the trip will be available to anyone, regardless of a student's\u00a0math level or teacher. In fact, Chute hopes that students, even those who detest math, will learn about math in a different way and appreciate how it is used in the world. <\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cI secretly wish I could scoop up 50 kids who hate math and take them,\u201d Chute said. \u201cThis is about math being something bigger than what you see on a day to day basis in your classroom.\u201d\r\n\r\nMore information about the trip can be found at the program's <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eftours.com\/tour-website\/1668162NK\" target=\"_blank\">website<\/a> or by emailing Chute.","excerpt":"A Paly math teacher is creating\u00a0a new\u00a0opportunity for students interested in learning about the mathematics behind international architecture, culture and history through a\u00a0field trip around Europe.

The team, made up of a majority of upperclassmen, is more experienced with three seniors \u2013 Harris, Courtney Lovely and Maddy Atwater \u2013 and five juniors.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings will be playing at Gunn High School for their home games throughout the season due to construction of the Paly Gym.\r\n\r\nGoing into the 2015-16 season as a No. 2 seed, an undefeated record in the De Anza league and No. 6 seed in the Central Coast Section, the Vikings are confident for a strong season, according to senior power forward Lovely.\r\n\r\n\u201cI expect us to finish first in league because we did last year,\u201d Lovely said. \u201cWe are looking to compete for the [CCS] title.\u201d\r\n\r\nHead Coach Scott Peters has the same mindset.\r\n\r\n\u201cExpectations are usually the same every year,\u201d Peters said. \u201cWe want to win league, compete for CCS Sectionals and go to the Northern California Finals. These are all tangible goals, and we can achieve them by improving during practice.\u201d\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the team realizes the effort it needs to exert\u00a0in order to reach this goal.\r\n\r\nCarrying out plays\u00a0is a significant part of the game the team strives to improve in, according to Peters.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe just need to execute,\u201d Peters said. \u201cThe girls are great at shooting the ball, but we just have to execute a little better.\u201d\r\n\r\nJunior point guard Lauren Koyama and sophomore point guard Carly Leong also remarked on what aspects of the game the team wishes to enhance.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are focusing mainly on defense and transition, and making sure we work as a unit,\u201d Koyama said.\r\n\r\nLeong also mentioned working on defense, as well as focusing on conditioning.\r\n\r\n\"As a team, improving on defense is our main goal,\" Leong said. \"We have also been working on closing out and getting into better shape.\"\r\n\r\nThe Vikings will play their first game at 6 p.m. at Menlo-Atherton High School.\r\n\r\nThe season opener is going to be a redemption game for the girls, according to Leong.\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope we beat them because we lost to them last year,\u201d Leong said.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School girls\u2019 basketball team looks to redeem itself in the upcoming season on Dec. 5 from its early playoff exit in the first round of the CIF State Girls Basketball Championships last March.","date":"2015-12-08 10:47:46","author":"Sam Lee","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/usable-3.jpg","categories":["Sports"],"tags":["alexis harris","basketball","carly leong","courtney lovely","girls","hoopsters","lady","lauren koyama","paly","preview","scott peters","season","sports","vikings"]},{"id":112721,"title":"School Board delays vote on opening new secondary school","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/12\/07\/school-board-delays-vote-on-opening-new-secondary-school\/","content":"The Palo Alto School Board will\u00a0make a decision at a board meeting in January instead of this month concerning the addition of an proposed new secondary school at the Cubberley Community Center.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is based on the preliminary recommendations of the Enrollment Management Advisor Committee, established by the board to investigate solutions for\u00a0over-enrollment.\r\n\r\nAccording to Supt. Max McGee, the decision was initially scheduled for the board meeting this Tuesday but has been rescheduled to a January board meeting to allow for a more in-depth analysis of a student and staff survey analyzing the benefits of a new secondary school.\r\n\r\nEMAC developed the preliminary recommendation thorough assessment and surveys. According to EMAC member Joe Lee, the first aspect of the recommendation calls for an innovative new secondary school for grades 6-8 and 9-12 at Cubberley.\r\n\r\nAccording to Lee, this choice school for both middle school and high school students will emphasize programs such as project-based learning or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ibo.org\/about-the-ib\/\">International Baccalaureate<\/a>.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe [EMAC members] ask for an innovative academic curriculum, emphasizing an experienced-based, inquiry-oriented team and cross disciplinary learning,\u201d Lee said.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_105204\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"380\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/SCHOOLBOARD.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-105204\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/SCHOOLBOARD.jpg\" alt=\"SCHOOLBOARD\" width=\"380\" height=\"253\" \/><\/a> The Palo Alto School Board convenes for the scheduled school board meeting.\u00a0The meeting aims to review a proposal for a new secondary school based on the preliminary recommendations of the Enrollment Management Advisor Committee. Photo by: Aidan Maese-Czeropski .[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe proposed school seeks to have between 100 and 150 students per grade and roughly a 1000 students in total, which will simultaneously reduce enrollment saturation in secondary schools.\r\n\r\nAccording to EMAC\u2019s research, Palo Alto high schools and middle schools are significantly larger than both national and comparable averages. PAUSD middle schools are 52 percent larger than district\u00a0national average and the high schools are 121 percent larger. Even in comparison to local and similarly structured secondary schools across Santa Clara County, the middle schools are 7-20 percent larger, and the high schools are 11 percent larger.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf we open a new school, we will be able to significantly offload the enrollment in existing Palo Alto schools,\u201d Lee said, \u201cThe creation of Cubberley takes care of 12 percent of current school enrollment.\u201d\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_113010\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"360\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/12346906_939036946172394_37820261_n.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-113010\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/12346906_939036946172394_37820261_n.jpg\" alt=\"12346906_939036946172394_37820261_n\" width=\"360\" height=\"270\" \/><\/a> the Cubberley Community Center site originally functioned as a high school from 1956 to 1979. However, Ellwood P. Cubberley High School was closed in 1979. Photo by: Emilia Diaz-Magaloni[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThese recommendations are largely based on findings\u00a0from\u00a0the EMAC\u2019s assessment of current schools. According to EMAC\u2019s investigations, PAUSD secondary schools\u2019 enrollment surpasses satisfactory numbers among a\u00a0wide wide range of criteria.\r\n\r\nThe schools are also larger than academic studies indicate optimal for learning.\r\n\r\n\u201cResearch shows school size functions primarily as an enabler of improved student outcome,\u201d Lee said.\r\n\r\nThe advisory board also found that over-enrollment was likely to worsen substantially over the years.\r\n\r\n\u201cOur high school enrollment, if left alone, seems to only get worse over time,\u201d Lee said.\r\n\r\nEMAC also found that the educational community was discontent with the current schools' sizes. According to Lee, the committee conducted focus groups consisting of Palo Alto Unified School District students, parents, teachers and administrators to gauge community opinions regarding the size of the schools. The focus group responses that the committee presented overwhelmingly expressed feelings of a discomfortable and impersonal learning environment.\r\n\r\n\u201cLess than a third of parents are satisfied with the personalization of the learning experience of their kids,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThere is also overwhelming parental support to extend choice programs within our secondary school.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe EMAC proposed that creating smaller communities within an educational environment would result in larger student-teacher connections.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe think this [choice programs] will achieve earlier socio-emotional connectedness, provide more opportunities to be known by students and help reduce stress during transitions,\u201d Lee said.\r\n\r\nMany students, parents and faculty also voiced\u00a0their\u00a0desire for more individualized and project-based learning.\r\n\r\n\u201cExtending choice programs to the middle and high school level would meet a community need and provide a learning opportunity that would benefit students and teachers throughout the district,\u201d parent Kristen Sega said at the board meeting last month. \u201cI welcome a new choice school at the secondary level for these reasons.\u201d\r\n\r\nSega stressed that although this choice school might not be right for all students, especially in a community that fosters innovation above all else, the board is sure to find broad support from parents and students alike.\r\n\r\nThe EMAC recommends the school board offers more choice and personalization in the new proposed school at Cubberley, as well at the current middle and high schools.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo an extent, these programs are already being implemented in our schools, such as in the social justice pathway,\u201d Lee said. \u201cHowever what we are talking about here is taking it one step further.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe site of Cubberley would not be unfamiliar to educational demands. According to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.paloaltohistory.org\/\">Palo Alto History website<\/a>, the Cubberley Community Center site originally functioned as a high school from 1956 to 1979. However, Ellwood P. Cubberley High School was closed in 1979 due to a large decrease in enrollment and funding. Since then, the school board has leased Cubberley primarily for recreational purposes.\r\n\r\nIf these recommendations are adopted by the board, it is likely that a new advisory committee will convene in January to create a task force. The task force will continue the process by deciding on design elements and spending costs, according to Lee.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are in a unique moment in time, with land available, enrollment that indicates we should offload students to a new campus, an appetite for innovation and funding available,\u201d said Lee. \u201cWe believe that these proposals are neither too radical nor too ambitious.\"","excerpt":"The Palo Alto School Board will make a decision at a board meeting in January instead of this month concerning the addition of a proposed new secondary school at the Cubberley Community Center.","date":"2015-12-07 16:50:55","author":"Emilia Diaz-Magaloni","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/12346906_939036946172394_37820261_n.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["cubberley","Cubberley Community Center","Ellwood P.

The class plans to modernize the plot of \"Metamorphosis: Junior Year,\"\u00a0according to Tom Franco, James Franco's brother.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe came across two strong themes in the story: \u2018What it's like to be a teenager today\u2019 and \u2018transformation\u2019 \u2014 having the characters go through transformations of some sort,\u201d Tom Franco said.<\/span>\r\n\r\nAccording to Wojcicki, the class is aiming to create a film with professional quality by May 2016.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe idea is to show how effective media is as a platform to teach students to think and create,\u201d Wojcicki said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to participant Paly junior Leah Benque, the students split into eight groups of five students each, with each group responsible for recording a different portion of the film. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students were assigned a separate role within their groups, including director, screenwriter, cinematographer, producer and editor.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Participating students have gained skills ranging from screenwriting to cinematography.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI have learned the format of a script and how important it is to stick to that specific format,\u201d Paly senior and director Brandon Fu said. \u201cAs for cinematography, we have learned about things that make it easier for the film to look and feel similar throughout, even though there are eight or so groups involved.\u201d <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paly senior Will Dougall says he enjoys being the cinematographer of his group. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI really like cameras and I really enjoy piecing things together with my own\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">perspective,\u201d Dougall said. \u201cI've really learned a lot about the filmmaking process [of] approving scripts, distinguishing roles and putting together a unified body of work.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Gunn junior Juan Santos, the workshop provides valuable experience that gives a hands on perspective of the film world.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cMy group is special because we all have experience in different areas of film so it's all a really big collaborative experience,\u201d Santos said. \u201cI've definitely learned a lot about what it might be like working on an actual production later on in my life. \u2026 We all bounce ideas off each other and it's just been a really great lesson in teamwork and what it takes to be a valuable part of that team.\u201d","excerpt":"High schoolers are writing, filming and editing a short movie as a part of the film workshop led by actor James Franco and journalism teacher Esther Wojcicki.","date":"2015-12-03 21:55:15","author":"Aidan Maese-Czeropski","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/DSCN2334-2.jpg","categories":["Features","Spotlight"],"tags":["acting","actor","alpaca","Bay Area","betsy franco","book","brandon fu","California","camera","celebrity","cinema","cinematography","class","dave franco","esther wojcicki","exciting","fear of snakes","film","filmmaking","foreign language","fresh","freshman","gossip","gunn","high school","high schooler","hip","hollywood","james franco","journalism","juan santos","junior","leah benque","mac","media","media arts center","metamorphosis","Moonshots in Education","mormon church","movie","ovid","palo alto high school","palo altoc","paly","paly voice","palyvoice.com","plot","professional","racism","screenwriter","script","senior","sophomore","teen","teenager","theatre","tom franco","will dougall","workshop","world war one","writing","youth"]},{"id":112600,"title":"ASB to host movie Friday","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/12\/03\/asb-to-host-movie-friday\/","content":"The Palo Alto High School Associated Student Body will\u00a0host a movie night 7 p.m. on Friday in the Media Arts Center.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ASB is\u00a0showing the winter holiday movie \"<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Home Alone<i>\"<\/i><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0to offer\u00a0students a\u00a0fun night with their peers.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\nASB will make to avoid technical issues like last year's showing of \"The Breakfast Club,\" where new equipment malfunctioned and overheated.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe technical issues [last year] dealt with the system being new and having some faulty parts,\" Student Activities Director Matt Hall said. \"Those parts have been replaced.
