Although it might be a little too early to dig those costumes out, there are\u00a0a number of ways to\u00a0start getting involved in your grade\u2019s preparation. You could provide your artistic ability in the float or t-shirt designing, contribute your dancing skills\u00a0(or lack thereof) to\u00a0your grade\u2019s spirit dance\u00a0or write a cheer for the lunchtime rallies.\r\n\r\nFor the freshmen or\u00a0new kids out there, one of the most exciting aspects of Spirit Week is\u00a0the daily cheers. During every lunchtime of Spirit Week, each grade presents short cheers corresponding with the daily dress-up theme, the activity or the class as a whole. These cheers are normally submitted in the grade\u2019s Spirit Week Facebook\u00a0group and picked by Associated Student Body\u00a0leaders\u00a0based on popular choice and effectiveness.\r\n\r\nWant to contribute a cheer to your grade but don\u2019t know how to get started? We\u2019ve compiled a list of the top six\u00a0tips for writing a killer cheer.\r\n\r\n<b>Rhyming cheers work the best:<\/b>\r\n\r\n\u201cI think what has typically worked well in the past are cheers that are easy to say as a big group and cheers that rhyme well,\u201d senior ASB Secretary Joseph Kao said. \u201cIt sounds more fluent and united that way.\u201d\r\n\r\nRhyming is one of the most important parts in creating a cheer. The end of each line should rhyme with the next\u00a0down to the exact\u00a0syllable to create a flowing, powerful cheer. When a cheer does not rhyme exactly, the class is usually unable\u00a0to chant it correctly and ends up stumbling over the words. To get the most points for the cheers, you need to perfect its\u00a0delivery. One of the best\u00a0feelings during Spirit Week is when your class is able to perfectly deliver a cheer without any prior experience.\r\n\r\n<b>Seven syllables, seven syllables:<\/b>\r\n\r\nAccording to junior class President Noa Ben-Efraim and junior ASB Vice President Anmol Nagar, the best structural choice for a smooth-flowing,\u00a0easy Spirit Week cheer is a two-lined cheer with seven syllables in each. Too many syllables can sound clunky and is often difficult for a grade to repeat back with ease. So when coming up with those cheers, clap out those seven syllables and if necessary, bust out a thesaurus to help find a word that could fit the requirement.\r\n\r\nHere's a few cheers used in the past that follow the seven syllable rule:\r\n\r\nThe Class of 2017 produced a cheer with seven syllables in each line for the gym rally's three-point basketball competition:\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Upperclassmen might have keys, \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0but at least we sink our three's<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Class of 2015 used the seven syllable rule in creating a cheer regarding their class theme (The Great Gatsby):<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0NYC around the bend, \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gatsby's party never ends<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>Be appropriate:<\/b><\/p>\r\nMaking cheers that are appropriate is key. Paly's Spirit Week\u00a0is a school event, so don't use any words or phrases that you wouldn't normally say in class. Stick only to cheers that judges will approve because points are deducted for inappropriate cheers. Boos and profanity decrease scores (as well as\u00a0throwing objects or disrupting competitions in any way). In the end, Spirit Week\u00a0is meant to be a fun and stress-free event, so make sure to be appropriate and create a safe space for all fellow Paly\u00a0students who simply want to show off their school spirit.\r\n\r\n\"I would make sure the cheers are appropriate because different judges judge things differently,\" Ben-Efraim said.\r\n\r\n<b>Focus on supporting your grade, not attacking others:<\/b>\r\n\r\nTry to avoid too many of those zinger cheers that put down\u00a0other grades. Although they might be fun to come up with, try to keep it positive. According to Ben-Efraim, this will boost scoring for your grade and means you can reuse your cheers.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suggest that the grade focus more on their individual grades instead of being sassy and cheeky towards other grades,\u201d Ben-Efraim said. \u201cYou'll get more points and you can have cooler cheers that can last the entire week.\u201d\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the judges will take off points for sportsmanship if any grade gets too nasty towards another. Although this hasn\u2019t happened in a few years, the judges will take off 50 points from a grade\u2019s total for \u201cany negative or inappropriate cheers, if anyone uses noise makers other than their own clapping and cheering, or if anyone is violent towards another student,\" according to <a href=\"https:\/\/sites.google.com\/site\/pahsasb\/sw2014\">ASB's website.<\/a>\r\n\r\nFifty\u00a0points can completely\u00a0offset a victory in a lunchtime activity or bring a cheer's first place score down to third place.\r\n\r\n<b>Show your school spirit:<\/b>\r\n\r\nSpirit Week's\u00a0main purpose is to unify Paly's student body. Even though each class joins in a strong competition against each other, the judges still look for students who work together, no matter the\u00a0grade. Classes that create cheers to show support for all Paly students show off their school spirit stronger than others. Judges love Paly-unity\u00a0cheers and will think highly of each class that cares about the school as a whole.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, teaming up with other classes\u00a0to show off your school spirit allows the cheers to be louder and therefore more powerful. The judges love when they see two grades working together for cheers. So get together with another class ahead of time and prepare a few cheers that you can both do together at one of the lunch or after-school rallies.\r\n\r\n<b>Be loud and have fun:<\/b>\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, no matter how clever or inclusive your cheer is, it won\u2019t make a difference if no one can hear it. According to junior class Vice President Natalie Maloney, being loud is the most important part of a successful cheer.\r\n\r\n\u201cBeing loud is mostly what we are judged on,\u201d Maloney said. \u201cSo that will earn the most points.\u201d\r\n\r\nMake sure as many members of your grade come to the daily lunch rallies, and make sure you participate as much as possible. So bring all your friends and be prepared to be lose your voice by the end of the week from all the shouting you\u2019ll do. (Don\u2019t worry, everyone else will have lost theirs\u00a0too.)\r\n\r\nFinally, make sure not to get too hung up on winning or losing points. Yes, getting in the competitive spirit is a key component of Spirit Week, but make sure you enjoy dressing up crazy and shouting along with all your classmates.\r\n\r\nHere are a few examples of Spirit Week cheers that have been used in the past. These are not all representatives of an ideal cheer, but demonstrate a class's unity in creating and\/or delivering one:\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/N8XqxpcbAIY\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"Want to contribute a cheer to your grade but don\u2019t know how to get started?

Many of the songs include explicit language and cover a wide variety of topics from her pet fish named Pablow to a song about Milk.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nMiley Cyrus surprised the audience at the Video\u00a0Music Awards on Aug. 30 by releasing her new, free album\u00a0titled \"Miley Cyrus &amp; Her Dead Petz\"<em>\u00a0<\/em>onto <a href=\"https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/mileycyrus\">Soundcloud<\/a>. The album consists of 23 tracks that range from simple piano melodies to electronic, upbeat music. We found the album to be less than\u00a0edgy, and confusing instead of original. As an activist, Cyrus could develop her music into something deeper and more meaningful, as exemplified in the \"Backyard Sessions\" that she presents on Youtube.\r\n\r\nIt has taken Cyrus some time to transition from Disney child star to provocative pop idol. To understand the full impact \u2014 or lack of impact \u2014 of her album, its helps to understand the history of her\u00a0transformation.\r\n\r\nCyrus first made her appearance in the spotlight when she was selected to play the role of Miley Stewart in the hit Disney Channel Show\u00a0<em>Hannah Montana.\u00a0<\/em>In the show, Cyrus sang various songs from\u00a0<em>\"<\/em>Nobody's Perfect\" to \"The Best of Both Worlds,\" both upbeat, pop songs with catchy tunes to dance and sing-a-long to. Her Hannah Montana image depicted her as an innocent and perfect teenager, a role model many young girls looked up to. But, it was clear after Cyrus released her 2009 single \"Party in the USA\" that she did not want to attain this image. Since then, she has released \"Bangerz\" which include popular songs like \"Wrecking Ball\" and \"We Can't Stop.\"\r\n\r\nCyrus also founded the The Happy Hippie campaign whose mission statement is \" to rally young people to face injustice facing homeless youth, LGBTQ youth and other vulnerable populations,\" according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.happyhippies.org\/\">The Happy Hippie Foundation website.<\/a> In May 2015, Cyrus released many videos called \"Backyard Sessions\" in support of The Happy Hippie Campaign. The \"Backyard Sessions\" include songs that Cyrus\u00a0sings in her backyard in order to raise awareness of her campaign, as well as to get viewers to donate money. She also invited guest singers like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=m2ua3O_fdCY\">Ariana Grande<\/a> to come and sing with her.\r\n\r\nCyrus has caused a lot of\u00a0uproar in recent events, such as her controversial Music Television host performance, and as well as how she generally displays herself in\u00a0public wearing barely any clothes.\r\n\r\nAlthough she is\u00a0known for the\u00a0hit pop songs she did in the past, Cyrus expands her musical range in \"Miley Cyrus &amp; Her Dead Petz\" by adding aspects of synthpop, alternative pop, and psychedelic pop and rock.\r\n\r\nWhen we first read the album's title, a lot of questions came to mind. Why is it about dead pets? And why on earth is pets spelled \"petz\"? But then we remembered that this is Miley Cyrus, an artist whose rebellious image is enhanced by the controversy she creates. The album just enforces the fact\u00a0that Cyrus has transitioned into an outspoken adult with wacky\u00a0ideas.\r\n\r\nWe were both pleasantly surprised and disturbed by the 23 songs that we listened to on this track. The\u00a0emotions we felt\u00a0ranged from happy to sad to flat-out confused. However, we would bet someone $10 that this will be no Grammy Award winning album and will definitely not have a hit single on the radio, hence why we believe that her album is dead. The songs try to be unique, but fall flat because they are hard to understand.\r\n\r\nHere are some noteworthy songs that caught our attention:\r\n\r\n<em>Warning: These songs contain explicit lyrics.\u00a0<\/em>\r\n\r\n<strong>\"Dooo It!\": <\/strong>\r\n\r\nWe are speechless, and not in a good way. This is the song that Cyrus ended the VMAs with and announced the release of her new album. We advise you not to\u00a0listen to this song (although that probably means you are going to go listen to it now). We suggest using the song as an alarm to wake you up, it's jarring enough to force the most heavy sleeper out of bed. Why? Well, the song consists of Miley and another voice stringing together random phrases in a sleepy tone.\u00a0The vocals are accompanied by a techno beat that increases in volume, and instead of complimenting the voices, it clashes with the other sounds.\r\n\r\n<strong>\"Miley Tibetan Bowlzzz\":<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThis song is a mere 45 seconds. It has no words in it, and instead Cyrus wails random song notes. You can interpret this as either artistic or the complete opposite, it is up to you. Throughout the entire song gentle strings accompany Cyrus' voice, creating an overall mystical effect. The problem is that there is not a lot of diversity, the song seems monotone, and there's no catchy tune to follow. It is, however, a good song if you want to meditate or do some peaceful contemplation.\r\n\r\n<strong>\"Pablow the Blowfish\":<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe title of her album makes the most sense when you listen to this track, \"Pablow the Blowfish.\" Initially, the tune of the song was nice, but as we listened to the words, we discovered that it was... well, interesting. Cyrus' lyrics illustrate the story and relationship that she has with a blowfish named Pablow. Not Pablo, but Pablow. She goes on to talk about how emotionally attached she is to this fish. In fact, she gets so deeply invested in the song that she breaks down into tears towards the end. It is probably the most bizarre song we have ever heard. If you took out the lyrics, you would find this song to be extremely touching\u00a0and personal. Not to say that losing a fish isn't a critical and emotional event, but wow, she really loved Pablow. There is a soft piano accompaniment to Cyrus' slow voice, which is actually quite soft and pleasant to listen to. Beware: the song ends with a clash of keys, so make sure to turn the volume down, because we were\u00a0very startled.\r\n\r\n<strong>\"BB Talk\":<\/strong>\r\n\r\nBB Talk is literally Cyrus talking, with a beat accompanying her in the background. She's talking about some guy who used to be in her life. You can actually learn a lot about Cyrus from this podcast-like song. She uses great detail to emphasize that if she uses the monkey emoji, you should know that things are not working out. The most Cyrus-esque thing that we got\u00a0from this song is how she wants to lick this guy's teeth, although we can't really comprehend what she means by that. She also talks about how she doesn't have any idea what she wants, which is\u00a0relatable for many teenagers. She calls a boy in her life a creep and says that she\u00a0wants to\u00a0vomit. There's just a lot going on in this song, much\u00a0of which is\u00a0revealing. The song shows that there is a person behind the celebrity image Cyrus\u00a0has built up. The song even has a nice chorus where Cyrus' smooth\u00a0voice\u00a0adds to the reflective mood of the song.\r\n\r\n<strong>\"Milky Milky Milk\":\u00a0<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe song begins with some weird, auto-tuned voice that says the title of the song multiple times. We think it was Cyrus's voice changed to sound different, but\u00a0it just sounds like an alien is talking. We're\u00a0not sure what is exactly happening. We\u00a0can't\u00a0figure out why the song is called Milky Milky Milk other than the fact that she keeps repeating those words. The song just shows that the songs on the playlist become even more bizarre as you go down the list. We do not recommend listening to this track. The song turns into a more echoey version of Cyrus' voice with the\u00a0occasional voice literally croaking in the background. The overall effect is unharmonious and there are too many abrupt sounds mixing together.\r\n\r\n<strong>\"Karen Don't Be Sad\":\u00a0<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe first question that we have is \"Who is Karen?\" It seems very inspiring that Cyrus\u00a0is trying to help Karen overcome some sort of struggle, possibly bullying. The main anthem is Cyrus belting, \"Karen don't be sad\" and then adding \"Don't make the rules\" and \"It's up to her.\" The song is\u00a0peaceful and contains some soothing\u00a0hints of guitar. A light beat plays in the background, and\u00a0a soft melody accompanies the lyrics. However, the melody is occasionally interrupted by some sort of sci-fi noise that sounds like a soft siren and static in the background. This is the high point of creativity for the album, but that's not saying much.\r\n\r\nOverall, this album is the most bizarre that we have ever heard. Cyrus' vocals are showing a lot of improvement from before and her voice sounds much stronger as a result. However, this does not make up for the loss of direction and obscurity. The pieces in this puzzle of an album do not fit together, and although Cyrus may be known for her randomness and controversial motives, \"Miley Cyrus &amp; Her Dead Petz\" is not something that we recommend listening to. There is no specific song that was outstanding to us\u00a0and therefore, just like her petz, this album is definitely dead.","excerpt":"When we first read the album's title, a lot of questions came to mind. Why is it about dead pets? And why on earth is pets spelled \"petz\"? But then we remembered that this is Miley Cyrus, an artist whose rebellious image is enhanced by the controversy she creates. Overall, this album is probably the most bizarre album that we have ever listened to.
