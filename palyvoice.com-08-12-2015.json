Max McGee, the decision was initially scheduled for the board meeting this Tuesday but has been rescheduled to a January board meeting to allow for a more in-depth analysis of a student and staff survey analyzing the benefits of a new secondary school.\r\n\r\nEMAC developed the preliminary recommendation thorough assessment and surveys. According to EMAC member Joe Lee, the first aspect of the recommendation calls for an innovative new secondary school for grades 6-8 and 9-12 at Cubberley.\r\n\r\nAccording to Lee, this choice school for both middle school and high school students will emphasize programs such as project-based learning or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ibo.org\/about-the-ib\/\">International Baccalaureate<\/a>.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe [EMAC members] ask for an innovative academic curriculum, emphasizing an experienced-based, inquiry-oriented team and cross disciplinary learning,\u201d Lee said.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_105204\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"380\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/SCHOOLBOARD.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-105204\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/SCHOOLBOARD.jpg\" alt=\"SCHOOLBOARD\" width=\"380\" height=\"253\" \/><\/a> The Palo Alto School Board convenes for the scheduled school board meeting.\u00a0The meeting aims to review a proposal for a new secondary school based on the preliminary recommendations of the Enrollment Management Advisor Committee. Photo by: Aidan Maese-Czeropski .[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe proposed school seeks to have between 100 and 150 students per grade and roughly a 1000 students in total, which will simultaneously reduce enrollment saturation in secondary schools.\r\n\r\nAccording to EMAC\u2019s research, Palo Alto high schools and middle schools are significantly larger than both national and comparable averages. PAUSD middle schools are 52 percent larger than district\u00a0national average and the high schools are 121 percent larger. Even in comparison to local and similarly structured secondary schools across Santa Clara County, the middle schools are 7-20 percent larger, and the high schools are 11 percent larger.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf we open a new school, we will be able to significantly offload the enrollment in existing Palo Alto schools,\u201d Lee said, \u201cThe creation of Cubberley takes care of 12 percent of current school enrollment.\u201d\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_113010\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"360\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/12346906_939036946172394_37820261_n.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-113010\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/12346906_939036946172394_37820261_n.jpg\" alt=\"12346906_939036946172394_37820261_n\" width=\"360\" height=\"270\" \/><\/a> the Cubberley Community Center site originally functioned as a high school from 1956 to 1979. However, Ellwood P. Cubberley High School was closed in 1979. Photo by: Emilia Diaz-Magaloni[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThese recommendations are largely based on findings\u00a0from\u00a0the EMAC\u2019s assessment of current schools. According to EMAC\u2019s investigations, PAUSD secondary schools\u2019 enrollment surpasses satisfactory numbers among a\u00a0wide wide range of criteria.\r\n\r\nThe schools are also larger than academic studies indicate optimal for learning.\r\n\r\n\u201cResearch shows school size functions primarily as an enabler of improved student outcome,\u201d Lee said.\r\n\r\nThe advisory board also found that over-enrollment was likely to worsen substantially over the years.\r\n\r\n\u201cOur high school enrollment, if left alone, seems to only get worse over time,\u201d Lee said.\r\n\r\nEMAC also found that the educational community was discontent with the current schools' sizes. According to Lee, the committee conducted focus groups consisting of Palo Alto Unified School District students, parents, teachers and administrators to gauge community opinions regarding the size of the schools. The focus group responses that the committee presented overwhelmingly expressed feelings of a discomfortable and impersonal learning environment.\r\n\r\n\u201cLess than a third of parents are satisfied with the personalization of the learning experience of their kids,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThere is also overwhelming parental support to extend choice programs within our secondary school.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe EMAC proposed that creating smaller communities within an educational environment would result in larger student-teacher connections.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe think this [choice programs] will achieve earlier socio-emotional connectedness, provide more opportunities to be known by students and help reduce stress during transitions,\u201d Lee said.\r\n\r\nMany students, parents and faculty also voiced\u00a0their\u00a0desire for more individualized and project-based learning.\r\n\r\n\u201cExtending choice programs to the middle and high school level would meet a community need and provide a learning opportunity that would benefit students and teachers throughout the district,\u201d parent Kristen Sega said at the board meeting last month. \u201cI welcome a new choice school at the secondary level for these reasons.\u201d\r\n\r\nSega stressed that although this choice school might not be right for all students, especially in a community that fosters innovation above all else, the board is sure to find broad support from parents and students alike.\r\n\r\nThe EMAC recommends the school board offers more choice and personalization in the new proposed school at Cubberley, as well at the current middle and high schools.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo an extent, these programs are already being implemented in our schools, such as in the social justice pathway,\u201d Lee said. \u201cHowever what we are talking about here is taking it one step further.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe site of Cubberley would not be unfamiliar to educational demands. According to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.paloaltohistory.org\/\">Palo Alto History website<\/a>, the Cubberley Community Center site originally functioned as a high school from 1956 to 1979. However, Ellwood P. Cubberley High School was closed in 1979 due to a large decrease in enrollment and funding. Since then, the school board has leased Cubberley primarily for recreational purposes.\r\n\r\nIf these recommendations are adopted by the board, it is likely that a new advisory committee will convene in January to create a task force. The task force will continue the process by deciding on design elements and spending costs, according to Lee.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are in a unique moment in time, with land available, enrollment that indicates we should offload students to a new campus, an appetite for innovation and funding available,\u201d said Lee. \u201cWe believe that these proposals are neither too radical nor too ambitious.\"","excerpt":"The Palo Alto School Board will make a decision at a board meeting in January instead of this month concerning the addition of a proposed new secondary school at the Cubberley Community Center.","date":"2015-12-07 16:50:55","author":"Emilia Diaz-Magaloni","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/12346906_939036946172394_37820261_n.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["cubberley","Cubberley Community Center","Ellwood P.

The article reads, \u201cDiorio says she often asks kids what they do for fun, \u2018and they can\u2019t answer that question.\u2019\u201d <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI know our students know how to have fun,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cIt [the quote] was said in the sense that students do not have enough free time. \u2026 We just got our Challenge Success survey results back and it says students only have about 40 minutes of free time a day. That\u2019s not a lot of time for downtime.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to both Diorio and PAUSD Supt. Max McGee, the timing of the article, one year after the death of a Gunn student by suicide, is one of the factors that contributed to their reproachful reactions.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI thought it was grossly insensitive to release it in November, a year after one of the students died by suicide, and frankly I was really worried it might trigger something, another tragedy,\u201d McGee said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why any publisher would do that.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">McGee, however, did applaud the author\u2019s effort to avoid oversimplifying such a convoluted issue.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThat\u2019s really important because people are quick to point the finger and blame someone for a suicide, but I think she did a good job of saying this is really complicated,\u201d McGee said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before the article was published,<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> senior and Verde Magazine Co-Managing Editor Siddharth Srinivasan was wary, saying he did not expect The Atlantic \u201cto uncover anything different than other articles in the past.\u201d<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Like much of the student body, Srinivasan felt ambivalent after reading it \u2014 he did not repudiate the author\u2019s claims altogether, but found numerous problems with the approach. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIn some aspects, the research was more thorough and more well done than I expected and in some aspects it was more sensationalized than I expected,\u201d Srinivasan said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Junior Andrea O\u2019Riordan took issue with the lurid description of the train tracks in the introduction as well as the ending line of the article, which reads: \"They\u2019re kids, so they can still forget.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThat [the ending] just struck me as being so, so wrong to insinuate that just because we\u2019re still minors, we can forget traumatic experiences,\u201d she said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In spite of the sensationalism, Srinivasan said he appreciated the author\u2019s incorporation of scientific studies, such as the \u201cU-curve\u201d phenomenon.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u2019s definitely interesting that she chose to bring the studies in because it really relates it to a more national issue rather than focusing in on particularly Palo Alto,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that was important to get the balance of student voice and clinical study.\u201d <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Srinivasan, the article\u2019s style of narration gives too much creative control to the author, which could embed a hidden bias within the story.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIf <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I\u2019m just a reader who does not have much knowledge about the Palo Alto community other than what\u2019s in the article I feel like I\u2019m swayed to a direction which is purely imposed by the writer herself,\u201d Srinivasan said. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cChoosing to narrate about the students rather than have them speak for themselves \u2014 I feel like it doesn't represent the students as well as it could have.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gunn High School senior and editor-in-chief of the Gunn Oracle Shawna Chen echoed this sentiment, saying that the article would have had more journalistic merit if Rosin had spoken to more students. Furthermore, Chen pointed out that by making only cursory references to the schools\u2019 various campaigns to combat the issue of student stress, Rosin conveyed a sense of defeatism.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI can\u2019t say that what her article said isn\u2019t true,\u201d Chen said. \u201cBut if she spent some time talking about the growth we\u2019ve had as a community, how we\u2019ve changed, how we\u2019ve moved past it, all these different initiatives that have been taken by parents and adults and students, I think that would have given students hope.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It remains contested whether this article offers crucial\u00a0new\u00a0insights on the problem at hand or if it is a piece tainted\u00a0with sensationalism, perhaps\u00a0even both,\u00a0but one thing is certain \u2014 it has helped to paint a stark picture of Palo Alto.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI don't want our reputation nationally and beyond our community to be just about this,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cI wish there was a way to change the narrative so that our story is, \u2018Look at all the amazing things we do, and look at all the talented students we have, and look at all the compassion and care and look at how we've come together as a community and responded to this tragedy.\u2019\u201d<\/span>","excerpt":"As soon as the cover of the Atlantic Magazine\u2019s December 2015 edition, a melancholy-inducing image of a teenage boy with his head buried in his hands, surfaced on social media it ignited an emotional maelstrom in the Palo Alto community.","date":"2015-12-02 20:00:26","author":"Emily Hwang","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/atlantic.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["andrea o'riordan","article","atlantic","diorio","hanna rosin","McGee","new york times","shawna chen","siddharth srinivasan","suicide"]},{"id":112592,"title":"Boys&#8217; soccer looks to conquer challenges, win league","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/12\/02\/boys-soccer-looks-to-conquer-challenges-win-league\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_112606\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"598\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/Screen-Shot-2015-12-01-at-11.31.04-AM.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-112606\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/Screen-Shot-2015-12-01-at-11.31.04-AM.png\" alt=\"captionsnsnsnsn\" width=\"598\" height=\"302\" \/><\/a> Junior defender Brian Tracy competes against a Los Gatos High School forward to win possession last year on the Vikings' Senior Night.

They will be difficult to replace. We will have to see how this years\u2019 seniors and juniors can step in and play near last year\u2019s high levels.\u201d\r\n\r\nDespite these losses, the players remain hopeful and hardworking going into this season. According to senior midfielder Siddharth Srinivasan, the team is well rounded in player skill, which will help with keeping play at a high level throughout the season.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are not reliant on one or two players and have good depth in every position, which is important if we want to be consistent in the long-run,\u201d Srinivasan said.\r\n\r\nThe team\u2019s league-winning past is something it is looking to repeat and build on, according to senior goalkeeper Eli Friedlander.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have a strong group, and I think we have a good shot at winning [De Anza] league again,\u201d Friedlander said. \u201cHopefully we will go deeper into CCS [Central Coast Section]. I expect that we will be competitive in every game we play.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Briggs, the team\u2019s formation is still developing, and players may be switched around to accommodate and improve connections.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are putting emphasis on modified medium-sized scrimmages to see where players fit in best defensively and offensively,\u201d Briggs said.\r\n\r\nPlaying a fast-paced possession style game will be a challenge for the team this year, according to junior center midfielder Jack Stoksik.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe need to work on our sharpness in passing and moving,\u201d Stoksik said. \u201cWe are often too slow to react to a good pass or to know when to break the line.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe team\u2019s long history and familiarity with each other\u2019s playing styles will benefit the team as a whole, according to senior midfielder Dami Bolarinwa.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are a team full of chemistry,\" Bolarinwa said. \"We have players that have been playing together for a long time and they know each other's strengths and weaknesses.\"\r\n\r\nThe Vikings are set to kick off their first regular season game at 3:30 p.m. on Thursday at the Paly soccer field against the Milpitas Trojans (0-0, 0-0).","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School boys' soccer team (0-0, 0-0) is focusing on living up to its success of past seasons, despite major losses in its starting lineup.","date":"2015-12-02 19:26:06","author":"Emma van der Veen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/Screen-Shot-2015-12-01-at-11.31.04-AM.png","categories":["Sports"],"tags":["alex bonomi","briggs","CCS","dami bolarinwa","de anza league","eli friedlander","jack stoksik","milpitas","preston kuppe","preview","season preview","siddharth srinivasan","Soccer","wesley woo"]}]
