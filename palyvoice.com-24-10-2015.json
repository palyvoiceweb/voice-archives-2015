The Vikings fell to the Los Gatos Wildcats on Friday night at Viking Stadium for Paly's Homecoming game due to poor execution, according to Head Coach Jake Halas. \"We had a lot of drops again and some breakdowns on defense,\" Halas said. \"It just didn't go our way, and that is the difference when you play a top team like Los Gatos.\" Photo by Cooper Lou.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Palo Alto High School football team (3-5, 2-2) fell to the Los Gatos Wildcats (4-3, 3-1) last Friday night in the Vikings\u2019 Homecoming game by a score of 42-20.\r\n\r\nOverall, the Vikings\u2019 performance was strong, but minor mistakes led to a frustrating loss.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe just couldn\u2019t finish in the red zone,\u201d head coach Jake Halas said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we played badly, it\u2019s just that when you play a team like this, there\u2019s little room for error. You can\u2019t make a single mistake against these teams.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn a disappointing start for the Vikings, Wildcats\u2019 senior tight end Miles Beach and junior running back Jordan Howell scored two touchdowns in the first three minutes of the game. The Vikings managed to climb back, scoring a touchdown in the final minutes of the first half, cutting the Wildcat's lead to 28-13.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe had a rough first three possessions,\" junior center Peter Snodgrass said. \"Things weren't going our way, but we fought back.\u201d\r\n\r\nPaly came back with an astounding trick play, in which senior quarterback Justin Hull pitched the ball to sophomore running back Paul Jackson III, who connected with senior wide receiver Eli Givens in the end zone for a touchdown.\r\n\r\nPaly was unable to gain the lead, despite having multiple chances near the goal line.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey had two fourth downs, and they scored on those plays,\u201d Halas said. \u201cThat\u2019s the difference in the game. We didn\u2019t score when we were down there at the 1 yard line.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Givens, Paly\u2019s rough start was a large factor in their defeat.\r\n\r\n\u201cAt the beginning, we gave them too big of a head start,\u201d Givens said. \u201cWe put ourselves into a big hole and we had to dig ourselves out.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Wildcats were focused on physicality and execution, coming back from a tough loss last week, according to head coach Mark Krail.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe all challenged ourselves to get back up and play the game we liked to play,\u201d Krail\u00a0said.\r\n\r\nThe Wildcats\u2019 success was not due to a lack of effort from their opponents, according to sophomore running back Paul Jackson III.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe went all out,\u201d Jackson III said. \u201cThey had a lot of big plays, and we just couldn\u2019t match them.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Halas, the Vikings can bounce back in their next game, in which a victory\u00a0would lead them to the playoffs.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe're just going to rally together,\u201d Halas said. \u201cNext week is Senior Night,and it\u2019s our last home game. If we win one of our last two, we go to the playoffs.\u201d\r\n\r\nPaly\u2019s final home game, Senior Night, is against the Homestead Mustangs (3-4, 1-2) at 7 p.m. next Friday at the Viking Stadium.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School football team (3-5, 2-2) fell to the Los Gatos Wildcats (4-3, 3-1) last Friday night in the Vikings\u2019 Homecoming game by a score of 42-20.

They are a good example of what we are going to want to have in the future.\u201d\r\n\r\nDespite having five different scorers on the scoresheet, the Vikings were unable to take down Monta Vista. Senior co-captain Kevin Bowers was disappointed with the loss and attributed it to a deviation from the game plan.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe didn't play our game,\" Bowers said. \"We usually play a defensive game and try to keep the score low. But this game was a shootout, and Monta Vista can shoot the ball pretty well, so they managed to put us away.\u201d\r\n\r\nDespite playing competitively in the second and third quarters, the Vikings suffered a faulty opening and fourth quarter, when they were outscored by a combined score of five to one. Johnson thought that the slow start was detrimental to the Vikings' chances.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe really didn\u2019t come out firing in this game,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe played down to our opponent\u2019s level instead of making them play up to ours.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Jozefov, despite the loss, the Vikings' season remains in their hands and getting first place in their league is not impossible. Rosati also echoed these sentiments.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was a tough loss, but the season\u2019s not over,\u201d Senior co-captain Winston Rosati said. \u201cNow we just have to recover from this game.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Vikings' next game is at 6:45 p.m. next Tuesday, Oct. 27, at Los Altos High School.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School boys' water polo team fell to Monta Vista High School on Senior Night at Gunn High School.
