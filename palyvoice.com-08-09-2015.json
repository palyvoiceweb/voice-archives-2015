In addition to Hull's strong performance, a balanced running attack from sophomore\u00a0Paul Jackson III, and seniors Tony Caballero-Santana and Shaun Pike kept Cherokee defenders off-balance throughout the game.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_107196\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"653\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/MG_83252.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-107196\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/MG_83252.jpg\" alt=\"Senior running back Tony Caballero-Santana makes a cut upfield.

A lot of nerves come with it, but I think I\u2019m making adjustments to my game.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Vikings started quickly when Hull hit senior wideout Eli Givens on a vertical rout on the team\u2019s second drive of the game. Hull attributed consistent drives throughout the game to his offensive line, led by senior captain Mikey Grandy.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe offensive line made my job really easy,\u201d Hull said. \u201cWhen we run the ball like that, I don't have to do much, but it could be better. It can always be better, but it was all right for the first game.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Cherokees were paced by a multitude of athletes including senior fullback Faave Brown and senior tailback Aya Brown. They briefly took a 20-14 lead early in the second half when junior quarterback Nick Demarco connected with Aya Brown on a slant touchdown pass, but were ultimately outperformed by the speed of the Vikings\u2019 offense.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey were getting the ball moving, they were doing a great job with that,\u201d Sequoia head coach Robert Poulos said. \u201cWe started fatigued defensively, which allowed them to use the same concept which we\u2019re trying for, which is [to] start getting some seams you can exploit.\u201d\r\n\r\nOn the Vikings\u2019 side, Hull was able to connect with senior wide receiver Riley Schoeben twice in the end zone, the second providing the team with a comfortable lead late in the third quarter.\r\n\r\nCoach Halas expressed his confidence in the Vikings' play after the game.\r\n\r\n\u201cI felt we were going to be able to run the ball, but if you had asked me about [scoring] 54 I would have said no,\u201d Halas said. \u201cWe got stronger and they got winded.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Vikings next game is set for 7:30 p.m. next Friday, Sept. 11 at home against San Benito High School (1-0, 0-0).","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School football team (1-0, 0-0) rebounded from last year's offensive struggles with a dominating performance in front of its home crowd on Friday night, scoring eight touchdowns in a 54-28 victory over the Sequoia Cherokees (0-1, 0-0).

The new SAT will exclude the notoriously difficult \u201cSAT words\u201d of the current SAT, such as \"punctilious,\" and instead will focus on more relevant vocabulary that students will consistently use in the future, such as \"synthesis.\" There will also be no penalty for wrong answers.\r\n\r\nThese changes leave many students, especially the juniors, to choose whether to take the old or the new SAT.\r\n\r\n\u201cStudents can take the old exam before March and colleges will still accept it,\u201d Cernobori said. \u201cMost juniors do not take the exam prior to March, as the vast majority use the PSAT as a practice tool. Juniors could take the current SAT, but I\u2019m not recommending they do that. Students can certainly take both tests if they wanted to.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn addition, according to its website, the College Board has announced its decision to partner with Khan Academy to provide free online test preparation for low-income families, in hopes of eliminating the inequalities surrounding these standardized tests.","excerpt":"The revised SAT is slated to debut in March 2016, and each change has been made to test the knowledge and skills that are essential for success in the real world, according to a press release from the College Board.","date":"2015-09-05 19:39:02","author":"Daniel Li","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/FullSizeRender-4.jpg","categories":["Uncategorized"],"tags":{"14165":"cernobori","8604":"college","12294":"college board","52045":"common core","49945":"khan academy","52042":"new SAT","8944":"palo alto high school","8953":"paly","52043":"redesigned SAT","49943":"Sandra Cernobori","29935":"sat"}},{"id":106830,"title":"Bay Area hotspots for Labor Day weekend","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/09\/04\/bay-area-hotspots-for-labor-day-weekend\/","content":"It's always exciting\u00a0to go on a trip for Labor Day weekend, but for those staying in town, here are a few fun, cheap activities to make the weekend great.\n\n<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/Untitled-Infographic4.png\"><img class=\"alignnone  wp-image-107024\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/Untitled-Infographic4.png\" alt=\"Untitled Infographic\" width=\"475\" height=\"982\" \/><\/a>\n\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/d\/u\/2\/embed?mid=zjB4wKLmGR6g.kgyyYuIgqxXM\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\"><\/iframe>","excerpt":"It's fun to go on a trip on Labor Day weekend, but for those of us stuck in the Bay Area here are a few fun cheap things to do!","date":"2015-09-04 21:50:45","author":"Mary McNamara","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/Untitled-Banner.png","categories":["Features","Multimedia","Spotlight"],"tags":{"50270":"bank of america","8512":"Bay Area","50272":"computer history museum","50271":"de young museum","50273":"foothills park","50266":"garden of eden","50274":"hiking","50265":"labor day weekend","50269":"mueseum","8939":"palo alto","8944":"palo alto high school","8953":"paly","50275":"redwood roller rink","50276":"roller skating","50267":"shakespeare","50268":"shakespeare in the park"}}]
