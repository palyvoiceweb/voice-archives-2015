Junior guard Jack Simison believes that a new coach may be a big factor in leading the Viking's\u00a0successful season.\r\n\r\n\u201cI believe with the new coaching staff and a lot of coach-able players, we will do better this year,\" Simison said. \"Once we are able to get the full team together our coaching staff will take us through what I believe will be a great season.\u201d\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_97467\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"465\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/IMG_0298.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-97467\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/IMG_0298.jpg\" alt=\"Sophomore forward Max Dorward boxes out his opponent in a home game against Wilcox High School last season.

The team went on to Central Coast Section playoffs, losing against Santa Teresa high school and ending their season. Photo by Josh Yuen.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nOne of the challenges the team faces this year is the loss of players during initial practices. Seniors Justin Hull and Mikey Grandy and sophomores Paul Jackson, Bryant Jefferson and Max Dorward were completing their football season, as the Vikings continued into the CCS <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/12\/02\/season-recap-football-falls-in-ccs-semi-final-to-milpitas\/\">semi-finals<\/a> and were unable to practice with the basketball team. However, Simison says this obstacle shouldn\u2019t affect the team too drastically.\r\n\r\n\u201cThose players will cause setbacks, but eventually we will be back to normal or even better than before,\u201d Simison said.\r\n\r\nThe team lost key scorers Kevin Mullin and John Rojahn to graduation, according to Diepenbrock. However, Diepenbrock said he believes this will provide an opportunity for the team to discover new talented players.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey both were very good seniors who scored a lot of the points,\u201d Diepenbrock said. \u201cOne of our challenges is going to be finding out who are going to be our scorers \u2014 that's a big void we are going to have to fill.\u201d\r\n\r\nSimison stated that he thinks this year\u2019s team is filled with great players who can be successful.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe team this year is a solid group,\" Simison said. \"I am proud to be playing with the selected players this year.\u201d\r\n\r\nDiepenbrock reiterated this thought and is entering the season hoping for success.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey are a very unselfish team and I think we are going to have a strong team chemistry,\u201d Diepenbrock said. \u201c I think it's a good group and I have very high expectations.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe team will take on Piedmont Hills High School at 5 p.m. tonight\u00a0in San Jose in its first game of the season.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School boys' basketball team looks to achieve a great season with a former star coach and its group of talented players.","date":"2015-12-10 14:54:31","author":"Chayenne Greenberg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/12363982_1716894831874746_346671881_o-3.jpg","categories":["Uncategorized"],"tags":["boys basketball","bryant jefferson","Jack Simison","john rojan","justin hull","kevin mullin","max dorward","mikey grandy","palo alto vikings","paul jackson","Peter Diepenbrock","piedmont hills high school"]},{"id":112766,"title":"Wrestling looks to rebuild in new season","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/12\/10\/wrestling-looks-to-rebuild-in-new-season\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_113053\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"598\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/Screen-Shot-2015-12-08-at-8.58.50-AM.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-113053\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/Screen-Shot-2015-12-08-at-8.58.50-AM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-12-08 at 8.58.50 AM\" width=\"598\" height=\"413\" \/><\/a> Palo Alto high School junior Seth Goyal attacks junior Emilio Bautista of Half Moon Bay High School at the Peninsula Varsity Tournament on Dec. 5.

This album is full of teen angst, incorporating catchy chants and simple melodies to make the songs enjoyable to listen to. However, the songs can become quite repetitive after a couple listens. If you\u2019re looking for fun pop-punk album then it\u2019s well worth the buy.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/embed.spotify.com\/?uri=spotify:album:3QblxoryrPYjRXFkucv0Sp\" width=\"300\" height=\"80\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\n<strong>Made in the A.M. - One Direction<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Rating: 8.5\/10<\/strong>\r\n<strong>Best songs of the album:<\/strong>\r\n\"What A Feeling,\" \"Drag Me Down,\" \"Infinity\"\r\n<strong>Worst song of the album<\/strong>\r\n\"Olivia\"\r\n\r\nOne Direction\u2019s first album without former member Zayn Malik, and last one before their hiatus, could very well be their best yet. Classic One Direction songs such as \"What A Feeling\" and \"Drag Me Down\" compose the majority of the album, yet don\u2019t sound completely rehashed like some of their previous songs. New styles of sound like \"Temporary Fix,\" which put a punk-pop twist on the typical One Direction sound keep the album fresh and exciting. The album hits very few lows, and even the worst songs are easy to listen to. One Direction is ending their tenure as the #1 pop band in the world on an incredibly high note, and hopefully we will get to see more songs sooner rather than later.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/embed.spotify.com\/?uri=spotify%3Auser%3A1216334347%3Aplaylist%3A4OkUksyk0jM2wGAyOOhcHl\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\n<strong>25 - Adele\u00a0<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Rating: 10\/10<\/strong>\r\n<strong>Best songs of the album<\/strong>\r\n\"Hello,\" \"I Miss you*,\" \"When We Were Young,*\" \"Remedy*\"\r\n<strong>Worst Song of the album<\/strong>\r\nLet's be honest here, we couldn't pick one if we had to.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_112891\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"250\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/adele-25-packshot1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-112891 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/adele-25-packshot1.jpg\" alt=\"adele-25-packshot\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" \/><\/a> \"25\" is breaking records after 3.38 million copies were sold in the first week, despite Adele's decision to not make it available on streaming services.

The album has a unique modern sound similar to '21', but still comes across as new and fresh. Powerful ballads such as \"Hello\" and \"I Miss You\" leave you speechless, while upbeat songs such as \"Water Under the Bridge\" and \"Sweetest Devotion\" help balance out the melancholy feel to the album. If there is one flaw, it's that the album is not available on streaming services and instead must be purchased.

Alessia Cara may only be 19 years old, but her album embodies maturity in its relatable lyrics, soulful tone and her powerful voice.\u00a0There is still room for improvement for Cara to find her distinct sound because she has incorporated many different genres into her music, but this debut album deserves applause.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/embed.spotify.com\/?uri=spotify%3Auser%3A1216334347%3Aplaylist%3A0SnDHgkYEs3kWoGhyu7ngB\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>","excerpt":"The Paly Voice rated November's top albums from some of the world's biggest superstars and bands.

Chute will take students to Europe during Spring Break to learn about how math is used throughout the world. Photo by Chirag Akella.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A Palo Alto High School math teacher is creating\u00a0a new\u00a0opportunity for students interested in learning about the mathematics behind international architecture, culture and history through a\u00a0field trip around Europe. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Math teacher Deanna Chute created the new program, Summing up Europe, after realizing that there were not any opportunities for math students to learn abroad and explore how math is used in the real world.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u201cI did a lot of research for a lot of time to see if there was anything out there and there just wasn\u2019t anything,\" Chute said. \"So then I shifted gears and said that the only way this was going to happen was if I made it from scratch. So I started bookmarking pages, collecting ideas and making spreadsheets of places with the intention of one day being able to do this.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although Chute had\u00a0been pondering the idea to host such a program for a while, it was an experience in Spain that\u00a0ignited the\u00a0idea in its entirety.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThis has been a very long time in the making for me, probably a decade or so,\u201d Chute said. \u201cI\u2019ve traveled a lot, and every now and then I have these moments when it all comes together. When I was in Barcelona and I was touring the Sagrada Familia [a famous church], I saw this magic square, which is an array of numbers where they all add to the same number in every direction. The numbers all added to 33, which was the year Christ was when he died. That was just amazing, just out of nowhere there it was. For me, that was the moment when my project was born.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Chute, the trip will happen over the spring break of 2016 and is set to include visits to France and England. \u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cWe will be in London and Paris for three or four days each,\u201d Chute said. \u201cWhen we are in London, we will be taking trips out to Bletchley Park and Hampton Court Palace.\u201d\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chute said she chose London and Paris because there were many mathematical\u00a0experiences available and because it was easier to plan a trip to countries that are geographically adjacent. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many students are eager to signup because of the unique experience offered. Sophomore Edward Kim expressed his interest in the program and the opportunity to learn math in another country. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI wanted a change from the usual lecture-based format of school, so a hands-on exhibit of certain mathematical concepts would be a refreshing alternative from sitting at a desk and taking notes,\u201d Kim said. \u201cI went to Spain on an educational school trip to learn Spanish a few years ago, and experiencing a new continent with entirely different customs was a life-changing experience. Not only that, but my Spanish has improved in leaps and bounds.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nChute said that scholarships will most\u00a0likely not be offered as there is no outside funding for the trip. However, she\u00a0hopes\u00a0that scholarships can\u00a0be offered in future year's trips.\r\n\r\nChute also hopes to\u00a0create\u00a0a club for students that teaches\u00a0the\u00a0math behind many historical features, regardless of whether students want to go to Europe.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cMy vision is to form a \u2018Math in Europe\u2019 club which anyone can join, trip member or not,\u201d Chute said. \u201cI want to look at the things that we will be seeing and the mathematics behind them in a fun, eye-opening and exploratory way.\u201d <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The opportunity to go on the trip will be available to anyone, regardless of a student's\u00a0math level or teacher. In fact, Chute hopes that students, even those who detest math, will learn about math in a different way and appreciate how it is used in the world. <\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cI secretly wish I could scoop up 50 kids who hate math and take them,\u201d Chute said. \u201cThis is about math being something bigger than what you see on a day to day basis in your classroom.\u201d\r\n\r\nMore information about the trip can be found at the program's <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eftours.com\/tour-website\/1668162NK\" target=\"_blank\">website<\/a> or by emailing Chute.","excerpt":"A Paly math teacher is creating\u00a0a new\u00a0opportunity for students interested in learning about the mathematics behind international architecture, culture and history through a\u00a0field trip around Europe.
