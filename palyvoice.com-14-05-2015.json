Math Instructional Supervisor Radu Toma\u00a0said\u00a0that Antink's\u00a0departure, along with the significant math course-drop from Bowers, will force the department to make some structural changes.\r\n\r\n\u201cExisting teachers would take on higher loads,\" Toma said. \"We\u2019ve lost some periods so overall we\u2019re not going to hire anybody brand new. \u2026 There are part-time people who will take a higher number of courses next year than they did this past year, and there may be a couple of teachers who have been on maternity leave who may be returning for a couple of periods.\"\r\n\r\nToma also noted that\u00a0Antink's departure\u00a0will be a huge loss, because as a teacher, she played a large role in\u00a0designing,\u00a0improving and refining classes in the department. However, Antink will not completely lose contact with her Paly roots.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe hope to still have her around for quite a bit next year because her job at the district is going to be mentoring and assisting math teachers in the district with the implementation of Common Core and alignment and math-related issues,\" Toma said.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_97201\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"333\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/IMG_0472.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-97201\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/IMG_0472.jpg\" alt=\"Paly Principal Kim Diorio stands outside of the Tower Building.

The duo has gained a fan base\u00a0both inside the Paly community and out, attracting listeners with its electro-indie sound. Paper Islands' Facebook fanpage has gained more than\u00a0400 followers, and several of its songs on Soundcloud,\u00a0<span style=\"color: #222222;\">an online audio distribution platform, have reached nearly 2,000 plays.<\/span>\u00a0\"Polygon Tides EP\" features four tracks: \"<span style=\"color: #222222;\">\u2206\", \"Tetra\", \"L\u00f8nely\" and \"Okay.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #222222;\">According to the duo, \"Polygon Tides EP\" has been in the works since October 2014. Th<\/span>e duo\u00a0released \"Tetra\"\u00a0as a single in late April after an extended Facebook publicity campaign using statuses, teaser videos and distorted artwork.\r\n\r\nIn creating \"Polygon Tides EP,\" Paper Islands does not fall short of its high expectations, with innovative electric sounds featured in every track. Each track on the album stands out on its individual merits, but combined together they create an impressive, cohesive style. The overall flow of the tracks provides\u00a0an interesting blend of electronic music and indie music, giving\u00a0the songs and style distinct\u00a0character.\r\n\r\nThe album begins with \"<span style=\"color: #222222;\">\u2206,\" a minute-and-a-half-long track that features a blend of natural sounds like breathing and water, as well as electric melodies. The track opens the album in an eerie-yet-powerful way, and effectively entices the listener to delve into the rest of the album.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\nFollowing \"<span style=\"color: #222222;\">\u2206\" is \"Tetra,\" a single\u00a0that reached more than\u00a0450 listens on <a href=\"https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/paper-islands\/tetra\">Soundcloud<\/a>.\u00a0Of all the tracks on the album, \"Tetra\" features the most impressive lyrics. The words, delivered with a powerful rhythm and melody, tell the story of a love \"smashed in the ground.\" Wang's vocals blend with a wide variety of synthetic sounds to create a memorable tune that will undoubtedly leave fans humming for several days.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\"L\u00f8nely\" is perhaps the most vocally impressive track on the album. The song opens with a soft acoustic guitar, which continues underneath Wang's powerful voice. The track questions what it really means to support another person, asking, \"If I turn into the sea, will you be there with me?\" Wang's vocal tonality beautifully conveys a captivating message\u00a0of longing and sadness.\r\n\r\nThe name of the final track, \"Okay,\" does not justly describe\u00a0the song, because it is perhaps the most novel\u00a0and interesting song on the EP. \"Okay\" opens\u00a0with a fusion of ambient noises, including indistinguishable voices and what sounds like a game of pool, which then proceeds\u00a0into heavy electronic beats and sounds with sad vocals about a relationship that is not in fact \"okay.\" This track showcases both strong vocals and instrumental melodies most effectively out of all of the songs on the album, with all elements coalescing to express the melancholic quality of the song. The track ends with the sound of a thunderstorm.\r\n\r\nAccording to Gardu\u00f1o, \"Polygon Tides EP\" will provide fans of the band with a recognizable yet original collection of songs.\r\n\r\n\"I think people\u00a0can expect a familiar sound that they've heard from our past stuff, with a new twist on it,\" Gardu\u00f1o said. \"We like all of the geometric patterns, so that's where 'Polygons' came from. 'Tides' was because we still really like the ocean.\"\r\n\r\nThe album does indeed feature several water motifs, keeping in line with the group's oceanic themes. \"<span style=\"color: #222222;\">\u2206\" emphasizes\u00a0the sound of running water, \"L\u00f8nely\" uses lyrics about the sea to allude to a broader message of being lost, and the sound of dripping water can be heard on \"Okay.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_103939\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"318\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/11216301_821755804560248_325488987_n.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-103939\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/11216301_821755804560248_325488987_n.jpg\" alt=\"The album artwork for &quot;Polygon Tides EP&quot; features geometric distortion set against a forest backdrop.

Paper Islands may make its songs available to the public through Spotify, although these plans are uncertain, according to Gardu\u00f1o.<\/span>\r\n\r\nFollowing the release of their second EP, Gardu\u00f1o and Wang also plan to release a music video for a song off the new album. Senior Jack Brook collaborated with Paper Islands to produce the video, which premiered at Teen Arts Council's\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/luminescencefilmfestival.wordpress.com\/2014\/10\/26\/about-luminescence\/\">Luminescence Film Festival<\/a>\u00a0on April 17.\r\n\r\n\"The goal is to release the music video shortly after the EP, so people are more comfortable with the song that's in the music video,\" Wang said.\r\n\r\nThe duo also plans to throw an EP release party in the near future, but the exact date and time are yet to be determined. According to Gardu\u00f1o, the event may be co-produced\u00a0by the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.teenartscouncil.org\/\">Teen Arts Council<\/a>, but many difficulties, specifically regarding location, have arisen in planning the event.\r\n\r\n\"It's in the works, and we are going to have a lot of cool surprises,\" Gardu\u00f1o said. \"It will probably be our last show, and we just want to wrap it up and say thanks to everyone who has helped us along the way.\"\r\n\r\nTo download the album, visit the<a href=\"https:\/\/paperislands.bandcamp.com\/album\/polygon-tides-ep\"> Paper Islands' bandcamp<\/a>.

The showcase highlights versatile student talent in acting, directing and playwriting and the diverse lineup of plays presented make for a fun and engaging evening of theater.\r\n\r\n\"One Acts\" is the theatre department's final showcase of the year, and while it lacks the grandeur of full-length productions, the showcase allows for heavy student involvement, specifically in directing and writing. The night features five one-act plays, all of which are entirely student directed, including a student original, \"The Sphinx,\" written by senior Guive Assadi.\r\n\r\nThe night starts off with \"The Marriage Proposal,\" written by the acclaimed Anton Chekhov and directed by senior Katherine Craig. In it, a man named Ivan, played by freshman Sam Kim, has his marriage proposal to Natalyia, played by senior Riley Cassidy, go horribly wrong due to comical miscommunications. Sophomore Joelle Dong's character acts as both the mother of Natalyia and as the mediator between Natalyia and Ivan. The play features excellent control of difficult language by all three actors, a tribute to the directorial work of Craig, as well as skillful comedic timing by Dong as the mother. While the pace of the play feels a bit rushed at times, the show starts off \"One Acts\" in an exciting fashion.\r\n\r\nThe next play is \"The Auditioners,\" written by Doug Rand, and co-directed by senior Hannah Nguyen and junior Sophie Swezey. The play follows no structured plot. Instead, it features a collection of comical monologues presented to a panel of stern casting directors. The play includes 17&nbsp;actors, by far the largest cast in \"One Acts\", each of whom contribute something unique. Particular standouts include freshman Alexandra Dinu as Auditioner #1, sophomore Chayenne Greenburg as Auditioner #3 and sophomore Jackson Kienitz as Auditioner #10. While the play is well-directed, it feels a bit too long for \"One Acts,\" and could have been easily been trimmed slightly.\r\n\r\nThe next play is an adaptation of \"No Exit,\" written by French playwright Jean-Paul Sartre and directed by senior Sabrina Sonner. The only drama of the night, the plot revolves around three characters: a man named Cradeau, played by Assadi, and two women named Inez and Estelle, played by junior Clara Baker and sophomore Claire Eberhart, respectively. The premise is that their&nbsp;afterlives involve being locked in a room with each other for the rest of eternity. All three actors develop a unique sense of character, and the conflict between Baker and Eberhart's characters is both compelling and effective. While the actors all did a fantastic job, the best aspect of the show is the staging, as it significantly added to the drama of the performance.\r\n\r\n\"The Actor's Nightmare\" is the fourth and final adapted script of the evening, written by Christopher Durang and directed by sophomore Jason Pollak.&nbsp;<span style=\"color: #000000;\"> The protagonist, George, played by sophomore Joey Kellison-Lin, is a man who is unwillingly pushed onto the stage to perform plays such as&nbsp;\u201cHamlet\u201d and \u201cPrivate Lives.\" His inexperience leads him to do<\/span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">&nbsp;ridiculous things such as slapping his scene partners, sitting in trash cans, and taking off his pants on the middle of the stage.&nbsp;<\/span>\r\n\r\nThe play leaves a strong impression, as the comedic display is phenomenal. Kellison-Lin's performance as George is both convincing and hilarious and the show as a whole perfectly fits the atmosphere of \"One Acts.\"\r\n\r\nThe last play of the night is \"The Sphinx,\" written by Assadi and directed by senior Oskar Soderberg. A mysterious figure named \"The Sphinx,\" played by junior Zoe Limbrick, comes into a high school student's bedroom and threatens to eat the student's paper unless she completes three tasks. Assadi's comedic writing along with Soderberg's direction helps bring this absurdist tale to life, and effectively ends One Acts on a slightly ridiculous note. While Assadi's script does have a couple jokes that maybe not everybody would understand, the creative original script is the perfect way to end an entertaining evening.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">The variety of the plays and the versatility of the Paly Theatre students in \"One Acts\" are impressive and speak to the strength of the department. While \"One Acts\" this year runs fairly long, the various plays are must-sees.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #000000;\">\"One Acts\" will play again at 7:30 p.m. tonight in the Haymarket Theater. Tickets cost $5 for students and seniors, and $10 for adults.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"After two successful performances, the Palo Alto High School Theatre department's \"One Acts\" has it's final performance tonight at 7:30 p.m. in the Haymarket Theatre.
