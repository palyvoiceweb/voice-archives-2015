[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Palo Alto High School Vikings football team (1-1, 0-0) fell to the San Benito Haybalers (2-0, 0-0) by a score of 49-34 last Friday in the second game of the season, a well-fought battle that was decided by a one-sided third quarter.\r\n\r\nAccording to senior quarterback Justin Hull, the Vikings played harder and performed better this year than they did in last year's game against San Benito, in which Paly lost 33-0.\r\n\r\n\u201cLast year we just got blown out by these guys, so it was nice to see a lot of effort across the board, offense and defense,\u201d Hull said.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings started the game off on a high note when Hull connected with senior wide receiver Riley Schoeben for a touchdown\u00a0in\u00a0the first 10 minutes. Immediately afterward, junior linebacker Jamie Cullen recovered a fumble on the Vikings\u2019 1-yard line, stalling a Haybalers' drive.\r\n\r\nSan Benito came back, however, with consecutive touchdowns scored by junior fullback Hunter Nye and senior running back Kyle Cameron.\r\n\r\nAlthough Paly senior fullback Shaun Pike tied up the game at the half with a touchdown less than 11 minutes into the third quarter, San Benito scored two back-to-back touchdowns in the same quarter. The Vikings' head coach Jake Halas accredited this to the Haybalers' wishbone offense, a formation that puts heavy pressure on the opposing team's defensive players. \r\n\r\n\u201cWe had a hard time shutting down that offense,\" Halas said. \"The wishbone offense hits very hard. We had some assignments blown, we couldn\u2019t really stop them.\u201d \r\n\r\nHowever, the Vikings didn\u2019t go down without a fight. Hull found receivers in the endzone multiple times during the second half, including a one-handed catch by\u00a0senior wideout Eli Givens.\r\n\r\nUltimately, San Benito\u2019s running game proved too much for the Vikings to handle.\r\n\r\n\"It was disappointing, but there\u2019s a lot that we can learn from it,\" Pike said. \"It\u2019s a good learning experience.\"\r\n\r\nThe Vikings' next game is against the Archbishop Mitty Monarchs (2-0,0-0) at 7 p.m. this upcoming Friday in San Jose.\r\n","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School Vikings football team (1-1, 0-0) fell to the San Benito Haybalers (2-0, 0-0) by a score of 49-34 last Friday, in the second game of the season, a well-fought battle that was decided by a one-sided third quarter.\r\n","date":"2015-09-15 17:58:33","author":"Jackson Doerr","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/rsz_2img_1239.jpg","categories":["Football","Sports","Sports Recap"],"tags":[]},{"id":108023,"title":"Liveblog: Girls&#8217; volleyball takes on Woodside in home opener","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/09\/15\/liveblog-girls-volleyball-takes-on-woodside-in-home-opener\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_108028\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/photo4.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-108028\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/photo4.jpg\" alt=\"The Vikings volleyball tea huddles before their game against Gunn on Sept. 23, 2014.

Photo by Adrienne Kwok.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAttendance will be recorded at the end of Tutorial beginning tomorrow at Palo Alto High School, according to a Schoology post by Principal Kim Diorio.\r\n\r\nThe change of sign-in time from the beginning to the end of the period comes after a <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/08\/25\/tutorial-2-0-mandatory-attendance\/\">major shift<\/a> in use of the period this year.\r\n\r\nIn the post, Diorio mentions how it is the Palo Alto High School administration\u2019s vision for Tutorial to be used as \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/paly.net\/flextime_learning_roadmap\">Flex Time<\/a>,\u201d or time spent doing non-academic activities. This includes opportunities such as <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/09\/14\/palo-alto-high-school-hosts-first-ever-yoga-on-the-quad-during-tutorial\/\">yoga on the Quad<\/a>, socializing, reading and meditating. Students can also continue to work on academic material.\r\n\r\nThe post also says that students will check in with their Tutorial teachers from 2:45 p.m. to 2:55 p.m. A warning bell will ring at 2:45 p.m. to remind students to check in.\r\n\r\nMath teacher Charlotte Harris understands the need for a new Tutorial attendance strategy.\r\n\r\n\u201cI believe that the administration wants students on campus taking use of this time, even if it\u2019s simply bonding with other people on campus,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThey want people to stay, so it makes sense to take it [attendance] at the end [of Tutorial].\u201d\r\n\r\nStudent reactions to the change in policy are mixed.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s kind of a hassle that we have to check in at the end now, but I can see why they\u2019re deciding to do it that way,\u201d senior Rachel van Gelder said. \u201cI know there are a lot of people who try to sneak out before Tutorial is over, so this will probably stop that from happening so often.\u201d\r\n\r\nJunior Jenny Zhuge is against the new approach to attendance.\r\n\r\n\u201cI just don\u2019t like that they [administration] made Tutorial mandatory for everyone,\u201d Zhuge said. \u201cIf you need help from teachers, then you should go and get help. But if you don\u2019t, and are just going to waste your time at school anyways, then might as well go home. For some people, going home and finishing work might be more productive than staying at school.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to junior Mackenzie Ferrell, Paly administration\u2019s regulation of Tutorial will be beneficial to students in ways that are not related to school work.\r\n\r\n\u201cTutorial is a great way to get help, but if you don\u2019t need to see a teacher you should be able to do fun things, and that is just what Paly administration is trying to do,\u201d Ferrell said. \u201cIt is a good time to socialize and get to know your teachers.\u201d\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Diorio mentions in the post that students must notify the school of a pre-planned absence before leaving during Tutorial, or risk being forced to stay.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you do need to leave campus, please have your parents contact the attendance office before Tutorial starts so you can pick up a pass to leave,\u201d Diorio said in her post. \u201cThe campus supervisors\/admin [administration] at the exits of school will ask to see the pass.\u201d","excerpt":"Attendance for Tutorial will be recorded from 2:45-2:55 p.m. to ensure that students stay for the entire length of the period starting tomorrow, according to a Schoology post by Principal Kim Diorio.","date":"2015-09-14 22:01:54","author":"Adrienne Kwok","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/DSCN03741.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"8458":"administration","53664":"attendance","39937":"change","53668":"charlotte","8644":"diorio","53665":"end of period","53667":"ferrell","53669":"harris","53672":"jenny","53666":"mackenzie","8944":"palo alto high school","8953":"paly","53671":"rachel","33850":"schoology","11060":"tutorial","53670":"van gelder","53673":"zhuge"}},{"id":107922,"title":"Paly hosts first ever &#8220;Yoga on the Quad&#8221; during Tutorial","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/09\/14\/palo-alto-high-school-hosts-first-ever-yoga-on-the-quad-during-tutorial\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_107923\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"950\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/11986473_10200509181809203_7819621335471777330_n.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-107923\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/11986473_10200509181809203_7819621335471777330_n.jpg\" alt=\"A sign advertising the new event during tutorial where students are invited to participate in a yoga class on the quad called &quot;Yoga on the Quad.&quot; Photo: &quot;Paly on the quad&quot; Facebook group. \" width=\"950\" height=\"582\" \/><\/a> A sign advertising the new event during Tutorial where students are invited to participate in a yoga class on the Quad taught by yoga instructor Lisa Haley.

I promise you will see a difference in your attitude after it\u2019s done.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Stewart, she and Lane worked with Yogaworks instructor Lisa Haley to create a class in which students are able to see the benefits of yoga. Haley will lead the session.\r\n\r\n\"There is no prior experience needed and you can wear whatever you'd like,\" Lane said.\r\n\r\nAccording to junior Yashvi Tibrewal, the class is a great opportunity because it exposes students to things they might not otherwise try.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s great that the school is taking the effort to organize these things on campus because it makes it easier for students to try out new things, such as yoga, that we may otherwise not end up trying at home,\" Tibrewal said. \"It\u2019s also a great use of Tutorial time for when we don\u2019t feel like doing homework.\"","excerpt":"Palo Alto High School will conduct its first ever yoga class on the Quad tomorrow during tutorial which will continue to occur every Tuesday.\r\n","date":"2015-09-14 21:37:46","author":"Aisha Chabane","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/11986473_10200509181809203_7819621335471777330_n.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"8953":"paly","53648":"yoga","53647":"yogaonthequad","41238":"zen"}},{"id":107592,"title":"Students react to James Franco film workshops","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/09\/14\/students-react-to-james-franco-film-workshops\/","content":"A wide range of reactions from students have been elicited after news of that alumnus James Franco will be teaching a <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/09\/07\/james-franco-to-teach-film-course-in-mac\/\">film production workshop<\/a> hosted at Palo Alto High School in the Media Arts Center.
