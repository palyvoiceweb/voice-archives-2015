Consequently, the school will encourage students to bring their own personal devices.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping to have students come to school next year with their own laptops, Chromebooks, tablets, or whatever it is that they want to use,\" Diorio said. \u00a0\"When they\u2019re in class they can just pull it out, work on it right there and put it back in their bag.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Diorio, the administration will not require students to bring any particular kind of device.\r\n\r\n\u201cSome schools have gone one-to-one with iPads or with Chromebooks, but we want students and their families to make the choice that works best for them,\u201d Diorio said.\r\n\r\nFor students who are unable to afford a personal device, Diorio said the school will cover the cost, although the students will still have to pay for an affordable insurance policy.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe would be using some outside funding to work on providing devices for anyone who needs it,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cWhat most schools do is have students buy an insurance policy, so that they do not have to pay for the entire cost of the device if they lose or break their device.\u201d\r\n\r\nSophomore Reetu Joshi believes that more widespread technology use will only be effective if teachers regulate it.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf the teachers don\u2019t have any rules about it [using electronics], kids will be on their laptops all the time,\u201d Joshi said. \u201cBut if they say, \u2018You can\u2019t take your laptops out unless I tell you,\u2019 it\u2019ll be better.\u201d\r\n\r\nAdvanced Placement Psychology classes have already piloted a technology program similar to the proposed BYOD policy,\u00a0in which all students are given a designated Chromebook to use throughout the school year. AP Psychology teacher Chris Farina believes that the new approach may prevent device shortages and reduce the pressure on the school to provide equipment for students.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt can help alleviate the strain on some of the resources we have in the various departments,\u201d Farina said. \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t need a laptop set of 32 ... you just need 16.\u201d\r\n\r\nFarina echoed Joshi's statement, expressing his concern\u00a0that\u00a0technology could become a distraction rather than an educational asset.\r\n\r\n\u201cFrom a classroom management perspective, the big concern for the teachers is how they\u2019re going to balance providing kids with access to the Internet,\u201d Farina said. \u201cHow do we keep them focused on doing class work in class and not on Facebook, or Instagram or Reddit or wherever else they would like to go?\u201d","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School administration is seeking to implement a bring-your-own-device policy for the 2016-17 school year to ensure every student has access to an electronic device.","date":"2015-09-08 23:06:08","author":"Dhara Yu","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/IMG_1715.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":{"52313":"BYOD","52316":"chris farina","52314":"chromebooks","52315":"device","8644":"diorio","17796":"psych","11642":"psychology"}},{"id":107365,"title":"Friday&#8217;s Safe and Welcoming Day in numbers","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/09\/08\/fridays-safe-and-welcoming-day-in-numbers\/","content":"Over 34 percent of Palo Alto High School students were absent on\u00a0Friday for Safe and Welcoming Day, a minimum day dedicated to preparing students for emergency situations and reminding students of school protocol, according to Attendance Secretary Karla Larson.\r\n\r\nStudents who attended school on Friday are now equipped with knowledge for dealing with future potential problems, after participating in Code Red and earthquake drills and discussing the Paly handbook, the academic integrity policy and bullying on Friday.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_107366\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"295\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/photo.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-107366\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/photo.jpg\" alt=\"Some classrooms were almost empty, as large number of students were absent during on Drill Day.

Her playlist consists of a variety of different musical genres ranging from the classical composer Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin to the electronic rock music of the duo Phantogram.\r\n\r\n\"Most of the classical music is from my childhood because my parents always played classical music in the house,\" Targ said. \"My two older sisters play violin and piano and I sing.\u00a0We grew up playing and singing a lot of classical music so that's how that got into my playlist ... it reminds me of when I was little and of being safe and having fun.\"\r\n\r\nTarg also notes that the reason some songs are in her playlist is due to her experiences with having to performing them.\r\n\r\n\"Some of the other songs I've found because I've been asked to play them at a performance, \" Targ said. \"Then I actually listen to it and really like it. Once you learn something well enough to sing it on stage without lyrics, you have to like that song or else you wouldn't do it in\u00a0the first place.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough Paly Rocks band is no longer in existence, Targ still performs with some of her friends.\r\n\r\n\"I sometimes get together with some of my friends and we go play a gig,\" Targ said. \"Like last week, on Sunday, me and my friend Russell Star-Lack did something where he played guitar and I sang and it was really fun.\"\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/embed.spotify.com\/?uri=spotify:user:clairekrugler:playlist:6rntKbUkV0a8KQzai7fMl9&amp;theme=white&amp;view=coverart\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>","excerpt":"This week, The Paly Voice sat down with senior Sylvia Targ and asked her to compile a list of a few of her favorite songs.","date":"2015-09-08 21:14:39","author":"Claire Krugler","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/IMG_0922.jpg","categories":["A&amp;E Section Spotlight","Entertainment","Tuesday Tunes"],"tags":{"8906":"music","52283":"playlist","33475":"sylvia targ","42416":"Tuesday Tunes"}}]
