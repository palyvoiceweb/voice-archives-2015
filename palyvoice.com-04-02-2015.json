(UC \u201cd\u201d fulfillment pending approval.)\u00a0Credits are CSU\/UC transferrable.\r\n\r\nPrerequisite: Successful completion of Biology and Chemistry or Physics.\r\n\r\nNanotechnology provides an introduction to\u00a0ideas of nanoscale science\u00a0and emphasizes\u00a0applications of physics, biology, chemistry, mathematics and environmental science. Heavily discussion and lab based, the class explores topics from\u00a0nanostructures to semiconductor technology and nanotech safety.\r\n\r\nAccording to Nanotechnology teacher Robert Cormia, the class offers the opportunity of a hands-on experience in the growing field of nanoscience, in addition to the chance to use cutting-edge technology.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis course builds on a solid science foundation in chemistry and physics and provides an introduction to the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology,\" Cormia said. \"We conduct demonstrations, experiments and a field trip to Stanford University. Students should expect to build a rich vocabulary, conceptual knowledge and hands-on skills , working with nanoparticles and making measurements related to materials engineering.

It aims to reach an agreement on previously addressed\u00a0main issues to advance to root cause analysis.\r\n\r\nThe Palo Alto Unified School District Minority Achievement and Talent Development Committee, having completed four out of 10 meetings since its launch in December, is addressing the causes and the main issues regarding the gap in student academic performance.\u00a0The committee has identified several key issues of disparity and established five\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/pausd.org\/community\/Committees\/MinorityAchievementTalentDevelopment\/downloads\/MATD%20Sub%20Committee%20Member%20List.pdf\">subcommittees<\/a>, each focusing to find the causes and solutions through research in areas of data analysis, best practices, focus groups, etc.\r\n\r\nCommittee member and Palo Alto High School junior Anna Lu believes the subcommittees will allow the committee to reach closer towards sustainable long term solutions.\r\n\r\n\"So far we've mainly been focusing on defining the key issues that affect minority achievement in the districts,\" Lu said. \u00a0\"As of two weeks ago, we formed the subcommittees to address individual aspects of minority achievement in order to work towards a solution. ... Our goal is to see what is and what isn't working for the district so that we can later implement measures that we know are effective long term solutions.\"\r\n\r\nThe committee, which consists of faculty, students, parents and community members, addresses the achievement gap for students of color and lower socio-economic standing within PAUSD. This immense disparity is evident in recent standardized test results from the School Accountability Report Card and a <a href=\"http:\/\/reportcards.edtrustwest.org\/district-data?county=Santa+Clara&amp;district=Palo+Alto+Unified&amp;report_year=2011\">D+ grade in educating minorities from Education Trust-West<\/a>, an education advocacy group.\r\n\r\nThe minority students experience the gap firsthand not only in achievement, but also with expectations based on race, according to senior President of Gunn High School\u2019s Black Student Union Chantel Winston.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are definitely different expectations we face from white students and other black students,\u201d Winston said. \u201cWhen you perform well in classes, you\u2019re too white to be black. ... But when you are with white students, you\u2019re not smart enough. ... You\u2019re too black to be white.\u201d\r\n\r\nWinston reflected on the subtle distinctions teachers and students make that contribute to the difficulty of being a minority in a school in PAUSD.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s obvious that there are many subtle things that makes things a lot more difficult,\u201d Winston said. \u201cEven among black students, there\u2019s a stigma that being smart is a white trait. \u2026 Palo Alto is a great place for education, but as a minority, it\u2019s very hard to fit in.\u201d\r\n\r\nData shows these difficulties, combined with a gap in opportunity and other factors, lead to less participation in honor and Advanced Placement courses and lower scores on standardized tests from minority students.\r\n\r\nStudents of African-American or Hispanic background in PAUSD schools accounted for a total of 48 AP tests in 2014 out of 3364 AP tests, according to the <a href=\"http:\/\/pausd.org\/community\/board\/downloads\/brd_packet\/item_014.pdf\">High School Measures Report released by PAUSD<\/a>.\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"overflow-y: hidden;\" src=\"https:\/\/magic.piktochart.com\/embed\/4357275-number-of-ap-tests-by-race\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\nA key root of the disparity in achievement among students is their financial and family statuses, according to committee member and Palo Alto High School Principal Kim Diorio. Students in the district face vastly diverse situations, and some can be deprived of opportunities because of the environment they were born into.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have students who aren\u2019t able to do their homework because when they go home, they have to provide care for their siblings, or maybe they\u2019re working part time jobs, or maybe they don\u2019t have an adult in their family who can help them with their homework,\u201d Diorio said. \u201c[Meanwhile,] we have other students who have college-educated parents who can help them or hire a tutor to work with them.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis inequality couples with the tendency of students to compare themselves with others, which consequently can lower their sense of self-worth, according to committee member and Paly college advisor Sandra Cernobori.\r\n\r\n\u201cI meet with students who are very strong students [but] do not necessarily feel proud of their accomplishments,\u201d Cernobori said. \u201cThey\u2019re comparing them either to other people or [to] some other standard, and they don\u2019t necessarily feel confident or successful. That happens across ethnicity and race, and I am concerned especially for underserved students.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs Terman Middle School Principal Pier Angeli La Place noted at a committee meeting, it is important to start encouraging all students to strive for academic excellence at a young age, as the achievement gap is not an issue relevant only to high schools. The transition between elementary to middle and middle to high school should be smooth in order to ensure a positive academic experience.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think the best way for us to foster academic excellence is by encouraging everyone to join extra-curricular activities,\u201d Lu said. \u201cStudents have to feel included and encouraged in order to succeed.\u201d\r\n\r\nCommittee member and Gunn sophomore Shannon Yang believes the committee can start by reducing the stigma around taking certain lanes. According to Diorio, the expansion of Paly\u2019s Advancement Via Individual Determination, or AVID, program is already in the works.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe school administration wants to use AVID as a vehicle to build the program and go that way [to improve the learning environment in schools], which I think is a fine way to go,\u201d Cernobori said. \u201cI think we want to see what happens with AVID first before trying something else.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhile working to close the achievement gap, the administration remains considerate of the entire student body.\r\n\r\n\u201cSome people are concerned that higher achieving classes will be dummied down,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cI think we really need to make sure every student feels challenged in the classes, which is not easy to do. We are willing to learn from professionals and other schools who do this well.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe next committee meeting will be held from 7-9:30 p.m. tonight at the PAUSD Office and is open to the public.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto Unified School District Minority Achievement and Talent Development Committee will meet at 7 p.m. tomorrow at the PAUSD Office with the goal to reach an agreement on the addressed main issues in order to move to root cause analysis.","date":"2015-02-03 15:38:03","author":"Takaaki Sagawa","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/unnamed2.jpg","categories":["Editor's Pick","News"],"tags":{"38291":"achievement gap","38292":"glenn mcgee","38293":"pausd minority achievement and talent development committee"}},{"id":97495,"title":"Voice&#8217;s top 10 Super Bowl commercials","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/02\/03\/voices-top-10-super-bowl-commercials\/","content":"&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_97549\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"431\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/150201-roman-numerals.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-97549\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/150201-roman-numerals.jpg\" alt=\"Fans gather around XLIX roman numerals for the XLIX Super Bowl in Arizona.

Several Paly teachers invited students to participate in this activity on Monday after the school was informed of the death of a Gunn senior this past weekend. Photo by George Lu.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the Palo Alto High School community received\u00a0the devastating news of a Gunn High School senior who lost his life to suicide on Jan. 24.\r\n\r\nOur deep condolences go out to the family of the individual and the Gunn community. While withstanding great hardship, they have managed to inspire us with supporting one another. Even as we grieve with our friends and neighbors, The Paly Voice would like\u00a0to pause to appreciate the efforts made by Paly adults to support students on campus during such a difficult time on Monday and the past week overall.\r\n\r\nWhen a Gunn junior\u00a0<a title=\"Palo Alto teen killed on tracks Tuesday\" href=\"http:\/\/www.paloaltoonline.com\/news\/2014\/11\/04\/palo-alto-teen-killed-on-tracks-tuesday\" target=\"_blank\">died by suicide<\/a> last November, there was no announcement made to Paly students, and most teachers led class as if nothing out of the ordinary had\u00a0happened. Although the administration and some teachers <a title=\"Administration offers support in wake of Gunn student death\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/11\/04\/administration-offers-student-support-in-wake-of-gunn-student-death\/\" target=\"_blank\">were very supportive<\/a> the day of the November suicide, the increased level of teacher support on Monday was greatly noticed and appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe Paly Voice would like to recognize Paly's teachers and administrators\u00a0for addressing the issue of suicide and mental health, offering emotional support and making academic accommodations for students who may have been affected by the recent tragedy. We thank our administration for acknowledging that a Gunn suicide doesn't just affect Gunn; it affects all of us as a community. We can only imagine how our friends at Gunn are coping\u00a0and what's being done at their school, but we hope they feel similarly as to how we feel: that the\u00a0collective aid\u00a0we students received from the staff made an incredible\u00a0difference.\r\n\r\nAt the start of this past week, every single 1st Period teacher read a scripted email to their class, informing students about the events that occurred over the weekend and the resources for addressing mental health. Later that day, Principal Kim Diorio sent an <a title=\"Letter to Parents Jan. 26\" href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/2015-01-26-09-48-39_letter-to-parents-Jan-26.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">email<\/a> to parents, which included an excerpt of the scripted message.\r\n\r\nThis message noted\u00a0several out-of-classroom resources, such as crisis hotline phone numbers, contact to\u00a0<a title=\"Project Safety Net\" href=\"http:\/\/www.psnpaloalto.com\/psn-plan\/implementation\/intervention\/\" target=\"_blank\">Project Safety Net<\/a>\u00a0and the Paly counseling office. When the required script readings were finished, though, countless teachers offered themselves to students as resources for emotional support, reiterating\u00a0how much they care for us students and that they are always available if we need someone to talk to.\r\n\r\nThe support continued throughout the day, even after 1st Period ended. Many teachers put lesson plans on hold in place of a day for mental health.\u00a0Of the 30-some staff members on The Paly Voice, more than half of us had at least one class in which\u00a0we had zero academic instruction on Monday (not including our 6th Period Voice class).\r\n\r\nTeachers offered a range of effective methods to discuss our thoughts, release emotions and process our situation. Many English teachers shared the <a title=\"The Cosmos and You\" href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2008\/11\/02\/education\/edlife\/quoted.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">same inspirational article<\/a>\u00a0in class and offered students to write down any thoughts, feelings or questions they had on a sheet of paper and to talk about those thoughts if they so wished. This open-ended activity was helpful because everyone can process\u00a0suicide differently.\r\n\r\nAbout half of the staff members on The Paly Voice had classes that took part in a \u201cGratitude Wall,\u201d an initiative mainly occurring in the Social Studies Department. Students wrote what they were grateful for on sticky notes and posted their gratitude notes on the whiteboard. In addition to the Gratitude Wall, some Social Studies teachers led brief meditation sessions and showed a <a title=\"Andy Puddicombe: All it takes is 10 mindful minutes\" href=\"http:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/andy_puddicombe_all_it_takes_is_10_mindful_minutes\" target=\"_blank\">TED Talk on mindfulness<\/a>.\r\n\r\nNot only did teachers focus on mental health during class, but they also made accommodations for homework and exams this past week. More than three-quarters of staff members on The Paly Voice were offered\u00a0academic accommodations for at least one class (again, our assignments for The Paly Voice not included).\r\n\r\nThis made us feel that teachers could empathize with our current struggles. Quite often, requiring academic work when students are under emotional trauma impedes learning.\u00a0Several teachers are not collecting homework this week, and many decided to delay the dates for tests and quizzes or make their scores optional in the grade book. These accommodations are incredibly considerate for students who have been affected by recent events and simply need a few days to recalibrate themselves.\r\n\r\nAlthough not every teacher continued mental health-related discussions after\u00a0the initial announcement, the difference in support we received from November goes noticed and appreciated. The simple yet thoughtful acts from teachers such as sharing food with students or asking each individual, \u201cHow are you doing?\u201d really made us feel loved and assured us that we matter. We thank not only the teachers who made their support known to us students, but also the administration team who did more work for us this week than we could ever know about.\r\n\r\nWe are so fortunate to have such incredible, supportive adults at Paly.\u00a0Their\u00a0efforts inspire us to reach out for each other, especially the Gunn community. We are all a part of Palo Alto, and we are \"all in this together.\"","excerpt":"The Paly Voice would like to acknowledge our teachers for addressing the issue of suicide and mental health, offering emotional support and making academic accommodations for students who may have been affected by the recent tragedy in our community.","date":"2015-02-01 21:33:23","author":"The Paly Voice","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/rsz_img_0469.jpg","categories":["Editorial","Opinion","Spotlight"],"tags":{"32449":"editorial","11240":"emma chiu","8751":"gunn","8752":"gunn high school","8771":"homework","8834":"Kim Diorio","37655":"mental health","8939":"palo alto","8944":"palo alto high school","37653":"student death","9135":"suicide","37654":"support","9152":"teachers"}}]
