Photo by Nika Woodfill.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nA <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/measles\/cases-outbreaks.html\">recent measles outbreak<\/a> that has affected at least 141 people across 17 states, including <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cdph.ca.gov\/HealthInfo\/discond\/Pages\/MeaslesSurveillanceUpdates.aspx\">two\u00a0in Santa Clara County<\/a>, has sparked a national conversation about the importance of vaccinations in maintaining public health.\r\n\r\nSomething of this magnitude, the reemergence of a potentially life-threatening disease, would usually generate much public discourse in Palo Alto. But alas, save for the occasional diatribe found on Palo Alto Online\u2019s Town Square, our reaction to the outbreak has been pretty subdued. After all, we\u00a0Palo Altans have been <em>entirely <\/em>responsible\u00a0when it comes to getting our shots, and as <em>rational, highly scientific beings<\/em>, completely acknowledge the necessity of vaccinations in preserving public health. We all know that it\u2019s really just the uneducated, impoverished, and\/or religious fundamentalist demographic groups that refuse to get their kids vaccinated and essentially allow infectious diseases to proliferate in the population.\r\n\r\nBut that\u2019s not true.\r\n\r\nContrary to popular belief, the anti-vaccination movement is most prevalent in wealthy, educated and generally liberal enclaves. Take, for example, the cities of Santa Monica and Beverly Hills. In these affluent suburbs, droves of parents have filled out personal belief exemptions, or PBEs, meaning that their children\u00a0can attend school despite not having the required shots because they have a moral objection to the vaccines. According to an an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hollywoodreporter.com\/features\/los-angeles-vaccination-rates\/\">expos\u00e9 written by The Hollywood Reporter in 2014<\/a>, close to 70 percent of parents have submitted personal belief exemptions in certain Southern California private schools, making the vaccination rates at those schools lower than those found in some developing countries.\r\n\r\nThankfully, the percentage of unvaccinated kids in Palo Alto is not even close to those frighteningly high numbers, and several schools in PAUSD \u00a0have a perfect or near-perfect vaccination record. That being said, data shows that there is a minuscule, surreptitious anti-vax movement within our city, and we need to pay attention.\r\n\r\nAccording to information from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.shotsforschool.org\/k-12\/how-doing\/\">ShotsForSchool.org<\/a>, an affiliate of the California Department of Public Health, approximately six percent of kindergarteners at Addison Elementary School in Palo Alto are inadequately vaccinated because their parents have submitted PBEs. This number seems laughably insignificant, but with a disease as infectious as measles, these few unvaccinated children could pose a serious threat to\u00a0other students, especially those with compromised immune systems who, for medical reasons, cannot be vaccinated. Individuals with weak immune systems are highly susceptible to contracting illnesses, and have virtually no defense against disease. If I was a parent of a child who cannot receive the proper shots for medical reasons, I would, rightfully so, be very scared about this measles outbreak.\r\n\r\nWe believe ourselves to be an enlightened and progressive community; the importance and infallibility of science is stressed by a great many. Yet somehow, there are people who apparently spurn medical facts (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/vaccinesafety\/Concerns\/Autism\/antigens.html\">vaccines do NOT cause autism<\/a>) and potentially put people\u2019s lives in jeopardy. Beyond being just plain wrong about the science behind vaccinations, anti-vaccination folks\u00a0are morally negligent and show a wanton disregard for both their children's health and the general wellbeing\u00a0of the public.\r\n\r\nThough its proponents aren\u2019t vocal, nor is it widely accepted, the anti-vax movement has somehow seeped into Palo Alto. This goes to show that even a city heralded as an epicenter of technological progress\u00a0isn\u2019t immune to the dogma of this illogical campaign.\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of Palo Altans dutifully take their children to the doctor\u2019s office for the proper shots and willingly comply with medical requirements, but in some ways, it seems almost as if we\u2019ve forgotten what damage infectious disease can inflict upon us. After years of relative safety and no large-scale epidemics (other than the largely underground HIV\/AIDS epidemic) in the United States over the past few decades, infectious disease is no longer at the forefront of our minds. In fact, we seem to be amnesic when it comes to maladies: The 1918 Spanish influenza outbreak, the most devastating pandemic in the history of mankind, is but an obscure blurb in a dusty history textbook. Polio, smallpox, tuberculosis and other dastardly diseases that terrified and crippled the U.S. population less than a century ago are rarely mentioned, even by medical practitioners. Advances in medicine over the past 50 years or so have successfully assuaged our fears, and as a result, we\u2019ve become almost ignorant of the horrors brought about by infectious disease.\r\n\r\nIn our never-ending race to innovate, and\u00a0move society forward scientifically, we sometimes lose sight of the past. It\u2019s imperative that we continue to progress but remain cognizant of our history. We can\u2019t forget why we get shots and work actively to improve medicine: T0 protect ourselves, to the best of our abilities, from the indiscriminate onslaught of germs.\r\n\r\nThis current measles outbreak is a formidable reminder that a select few in one of the most highly educated and affluent communities -- our community -- are rejecting well-established medical claims in favor of rhetoric from anti-vax demagogues. But more importantly, the rise in measles cases across the United States demonstrates that we haven\u2019t conquered disease; clearly, we have quite a bit of work to do as a nation if we want to avoid future public health disasters. Those of us who have been properly vaccinated have already solved part of the problem. The next step is to move away from our\u00a0collective sense of complacency. I'm not saying that we need to go out and\u00a0start\u00a0what would essentially be a witch-hunt for all people who may be opposed\u00a0to vaccinations. What we do need to do is\u00a0acknowledge that infectious disease has not been eradicated, and be more aware of the fact that\u00a0it poses a very real threat to our livelihood.","excerpt":"In light of a recent measles outbreak that has affected at least 141 people across 17 states, including two in Santa Clara County, staff writer Dhara Yu weighs in on public health issues which plague our community.","date":"2015-02-24 13:50:09","author":"Dhara Yu","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/DSC_0001.jpg","categories":["Opinion","Spotlight"],"tags":{"39059":"anti-vaccination movement","39058":"anti-vax","39061":"disease","39056":"infectious disease","39055":"measles","8927":"opinion","39060":"outbreak","8939":"palo alto","8944":"palo alto high school","8977":"PAUSD","39057":"public health"}},{"id":98589,"title":"From a #SSS: Narrowing your college list","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/02\/24\/from-a-sss-narrowing-your-college-list\/","content":"As second semester seniors (a.k.a. #SSS), we have begun to reflect back on our high school experiences and look to pass along helpful advice and lessons we have learned.\r\n\r\nFor Palo Alto High School juniors looking toward next year, the college application process may seem like it's looming over your\u00a0heads. Narrowing your college list is the first step in what can be a long, and arduous process. Finalizing which colleges and universities you wish to apply to can take months, so it\u2019s best to start as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nHere are a few tips that we found helpful in narrowing down our own lists:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><b>Check out or buy college books<\/b><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nThere are close to 5,000 colleges in the United States, which can be extremely overwhelming. Luckily, a good way to dip your toes into the ocean of colleges is to start flipping through a college guide book, such as the \"Fiske Guide to Colleges\" or The Princeton Review's \"The Best 379 Colleges.\" These books offer an overview of many schools, various stats and some insight into student life. You can get a sense for what schools are out there and what you want in a college by skimming through the books and picking out attributes that appeal to you. These books can be purchased in bookstores and online or rented out for free at the College and Career Center or at a local library.\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><b>List out attributes<\/b><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nAfter getting a sense for what's out there, it's a good time to focus in on what you specifically want. One of the strategies that worked well for us is to divide the attributes we were looking for into two categories: must-haves and like-to-haves. Those under the must-haves would be deal-breakers (such as the student body size or location of campus), whereas those under like-to-haves are things you could see yourself living without (such as having a good football team or the type of weather on campus). There are many Internet resources that will give you suggestions based on requirements you input like <a href=\"https:\/\/connection.naviance.com\/family-connection\/auth\/login\/?hsid=pahs\">Naviance<\/a>\u00a0and <a href=\"https:\/\/bigfuture.collegeboard.org\/college-search\">The College Board<\/a>. There are also sites like <a href=\"https:\/\/colleges.niche.com\/\">College Prowler,\u00a0<\/a>which host reviews from actual students at that school.\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><b>Seek out advice<\/b><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nIf you start getting lost in the sea of college info that\u2019s out there, it may be time to talk to a professional. Luckily, that\u2019s exactly what the College and Career Center counselors are there for. All college-bound Paly juniors are recommended by their advisers to schedule a meeting with their corresponding C&amp;CC counselor \u2014\u00a0something we recommend being on top of, since the meeting time slots fill up quickly. These meetings can help focus your college list with their realistic advice and give you a different perspective on your college process so far. Paly grads are also good resources regarding the college process and are usually happy to give their advice if you reach out to them. Some may also choose to hire a private college advisor if they want additional services.\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><b>Visit colleges to get a feel for different kinds of campuses<\/b><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nIt\u2019s one thing to read about a college, but it's a whole other thing to actually experience a college. Knowing how you feel on a campus and getting placed in that environment can help you narrow down what you like in a college. You don\u2019t even have to go out of the Bay Area <span style=\"color: #252525;\">\u2014\u00a0<\/span>there are a variety of colleges within driving distance, such as Santa Clara University (27 minutes from Paly); University of California, Berkeley (59 minutes); Stanford University (5\u00a0minutes); and San Jose State University (32 minutes). Even if you aren\u2019t interested in that particular college, going to visit can help you understand how you\u2019d feel on a campus of that size, with that size of student body and in that environment. Sitting in on a class can also be invaluable in getting a feel for the classroom dynamics <span style=\"color: #252525;\">\u2014<\/span>\u00a0there are a range of styles from large lecture halls to smaller, discussion-based classrooms. Since this is a place you may hope to attend for a couple of years you want to know what the education you will be getting will be like. We recommend choosing a weekend or break to visit a variety of colleges.\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><b>Choose a variety<\/b><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nWe have all heard of the Ivies and the top 25 colleges in the country, but there are so many great colleges out there to choose from <span style=\"color: #252525;\">\u2014<\/span>\u00a0many you probably have never even heard about before. We recommend that you choose colleges because they have attributes that appeal to you, like a unique major or great school atmosphere, and not solely because of the name. That being said, dream big, but you should definitely have reasonable back ups. Also, don\u2019t overlook or underestimate safety or match schools. Naviance is a great tool to compare your academic statistics to former\u00a0Paly students who applied to schools you're interested in. Remember, these statistics are only a part of the application, but they are a great starting point to see how realistic your list is. Keep in mind\u00a0that any school on your list should be one where you see yourself succeeding and enjoying the next few years of your life.","excerpt":"As second semester seniors (a.k.a. #SSS), we have begun to reflect back on our high school experiences and look to pass along helpful advice and lessons we have learned.

You do have a place and we can make this a better world whether standing up for someone being bullied or leading a march, it all matters. Sometimes in ways that we will never know because we never know who or how many people are watching us. Act as if the world is watching, because it is.\u201d\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Holman wants to create a communication channel between youth and the city.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere have been a bunch of meetings that have been organized to give youth a voice in the community and I encourage [youth] to seek them out,\u201d Holman said.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_99069\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/photo-1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-99069\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/photo-1.jpg\" alt=\"Former Palo Alto mayors and city council members listen to the address and with currently serving council members.

Photo courtesy of Warner Bros.[\/caption]The title of the movie says it all: war, patriotism and of course, snipers. This war movie not only includes numerous fighting scenes, but also flashes of the life a soldier experiences and how far some soldiers are\u00a0willing to go for a country they love. \"American Sniper\"\u00a0tells the story through a unique perspective by taking a deep look into one soldier's experiences. However, while the movie reaches the expectations for a great\u00a0action movie and realistic war movie, it does not quite reach the goal of being the perfectly thought-out biography.\r\n\r\n\u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d is a true story based on Chris Kyle\u2019s autobiography as a Navy SEAL in Iraq after the United States declared war on terrorism. Kyle (Bradley Cooper) is a Texan cowboy who grew up with a father who taught him to classify people as\u00a0wolves, sheep and sheepdogs that protect the innocent. The childhood lesson resurfaces in Kyle\u2019s life when he joins the SEALs, after he decides it\u2019s time he did something more with his life. Kyle meets his future wife Taya (Sienna Miller) in a surprisingly lighthearted scene, and after some playful bantering and courtship, they marry before Kyle leaves for Iraq. The movie then proceeds to follows him through his four tours, over a hundred kills, his struggle to stay in touch with his wife and through his assimilation into society after losing friends along the way.\r\n\r\nDirector Clint Eastwood attempts to portray the reasoning behind the violence war requires by emphasizing the themes of vengeance against terrorism and the price good men pay in the fight against evil through Kyle\u2019s story. However, while there is a strong focus on Kyle\u2019s beliefs on the war and his duty, the lens Eastwood uses primarily provides justification for the war instead of focusing more on troubling consequences and opposing views.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_99197\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"643\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/americansniper26.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-99197\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/americansniper26.jpg\" alt=\"As a sniper, Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) protects the American soldiers moving through the Iraqi streets.

He eventually becomes the most efficient sniper in U.S. history. Photo courtesy of\u00a0Warner Bros.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe action scenes are\u00a0beautifully done with interesting camera angles and none of the overly loud and unnecessary music that can be distracting in a serious war movie. There are\u00a0also scenes flashing between Kyle\u2019s perspective and his wife\u2019s perspective during phone conversations that add strength and realism\u00a0to their relationship, which could have otherwise been easily overlooked. Bradley Cooper\u2019s transformation into a bulky, Texan soldier is\u00a0not only amazing physically, but it also remained unwaveringly realistic throughout the movie in a showcase of dedicated acting. As\u00a0Taya, Sienna Miller's emotions seem authentic, and her performance as\u00a0the worried wife helps the audience connect to the couple's struggles.\r\n\r\n\u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d provides a direct look into the lives of soldiers and a moving snapshot of their dedication to protect their country. The movie is not afraid to illustrate not only the struggles of the soldiers, but also the terrifying experiences of affected Iraqi citizens. As an action movie, it meets all standards. As a drama, it paints a gritty but also touching look into one man\u2019s life. Still, while it is a good and sometimes even thematically deep war movie, \u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d does not explore enough of the varying aspects of war issues to be considered one of the best war movies of all time.\r\n\r\n<strong>\"American Sniper\"<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>2 hours, 14 minutes<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Rated R for for strong and disturbing war violence, and language throughout, including some sexual references<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Directed by Clint Eastwood<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>With Bradley Cooper, Sienna Miller, Kyle Gallner<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Oscar Nominations: Best Picture, Actor in a Leading Role (Bradley Cooper), Adapted Screenplay, Film Editing, Sound Editing and Sound Mixing<\/strong>","excerpt":"The title of the movie says it all: war, patriotism and of course, snipers.
