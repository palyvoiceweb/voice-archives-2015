The relay race featured six activities: \u201cEgg on Spoon,\u201d \u201cNeck Grab,\u201d \u201cWheelbarrow Races,\u201d \"Football Game,\u201d \u201cBelly Burst\u201d and \u201cTarp Carry.\u201d\r\n\r\nEn route to the championship game, the seniors beat the freshmen while the juniors beat the sophomores.

I\u2019m not concerned. I\u2019m not concerned at all.\u201d\r\n\r\nDespite how the\u00a0relay debuted certain\u00a0activities for the first time, junior Spirit Commissioner Cezanne Lane thought that the relay went well.\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought that today ...\u00a0went really smoothly,\u201d Lane said. \u201cI was really excited for the activities we chose for it [lunch relay] because a lot of them were new. It was cool to try something new and it worked out which was great.\u201d\r\n\r\nSpirit Week will continue with the Night Rally at 7 p.m. tonight at the football field.\r\n<div id=\"cp_widget_4253954c-5882-4bd7-a80b-ccdd4ac73952\">\r\n\r\n...<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\/\/ <![CDATA[\r\nvar cpo = []; cpo[\"_object\"] =\"cp_widget_4253954c-5882-4bd7-a80b-ccdd4ac73952\"; cpo[\"_fid\"] = \"A0GAuDtISokb\";\r\nvar _cpmp = _cpmp || []; _cpmp.push(cpo);\r\n(function() { var cp = document.createElement(\"script\"); cp.type = \"text\/javascript\";\r\ncp.async = true; cp.src = \"\/\/www.cincopa.com\/media-platform\/runtime\/libasync.js\";\r\nvar c = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0];\r\nc.parentNode.insertBefore(cp, c); })(); \r\n\/\/ ]]><\/script><noscript>Powered by Cincopa <a href='http:\/\/www.cincopa.com\/video-hosting'>Video Hosting for Business<\/a> solution.<\/noscript>\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"The seniors continued their streak of success at the lunch rally today, Day Three of Palo Alto High School's Spirit Week, by winning first place over the juniors in the relay race.","date":"2015-10-21 19:14:26","author":"Sam Lee","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/spirit-week-d3.8.jpg","categories":["Spirit Week 2015"],"tags":["#palyspirit","ASB","Associated Student Body","color","color day","freshmen","juniors","night rally","seniors","Sophomores","spirit","Spirit Week","week"]},{"id":110380,"title":"Preview: Festivities for all ages on Generation Day","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/10\/21\/preview-festivities-for-all-ages-on-generation-day\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_42917\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"694\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMG_0907.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-42917\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/10\/IMG_0907.jpg\" alt=\"The seniors of the Class of 2013 cheer on their classmates while donning their &quot;Senior Citizen&quot; costumes during day four of Spirit Week 2012. \" width=\"694\" height=\"518\" \/><\/a> The Class of 2013 seniors\u00a0cheer on their classmates while donning their \"senior citizen\" costumes during Day Four of Spirit Week 2012.

Photo by Aisha Chabane.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Paly Voice sat down with singer, songwriter and musician junior Georgina Wu to discuss her musical journey and to compile a list of her favorite songs.\r\n\r\nWu is an active member of the choir community and also writes and performs music whenever she gets a chance.\r\n\r\nAccording to Wu, her musical journey began when she discovered the world of Spotify.\r\n\r\n\u201cI downloaded anything that I could get, anything that I thought sounded good,\u201d Wu said. \u201cI listened to it all the time. Since then, listening to music has become a really huge part of my life. I would feel really weird if I didn\u2019t listen to music everyday.\u201d\r\n\r\nNot only is Wu a singer and songwriter, she also enjoys playing the piano and guitar.\r\n\r\nAccording to Wu, her vocal coach Ying Wang discovered her talent when she was a freshman and thanks to Wang\u2019s assistance Wu has more confidence in her singing abilities.\r\n\r\n\u201cBefore I met that teacher I thought that I was okay in singing, but when I met her she taught me techniques and made me realize how good I am,\u201d Wu said. \u201cShe brought me into music and she always had the confidence in me.\u201d\r\n\r\nWu gets ideas and techniques from a variety of artists but her biggest creative inspiration is Lady Gaga.\r\n\r\n\u201cI look up to all different artists, I take all different things, and performing styles and techniques from all different artists,\u201d Wu said. \u201cBut for inspiration I really like Lady Gaga. She just does not care.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Wu, her taste in music has changed as she got older.\r\n\r\n\u201cI used to listen to really poppy music like Britney Spears and Taylor Swift,\u201d Wu said. \u201cI really got into rocky alternative and later I listened to R&amp;B rap songs. Right now I\u2019m really into dance electronic music, but through all of this I have always had a fascination with classical music.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Wu, music has made her a more sensitive person and encourages others to try music.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think it raises your emotional sensitivity and listening or playing music will make you a more compassionate and a kind person,\" Wu said.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/embed.spotify.com\/?uri=spotify%3Auser%3Aaishachabane%3Aplaylist%3A3vwhjl1mqzmKJvtUSQudUv\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>","excerpt":"The Paly Voice sat down with singer,songwriter and talented musician junior Georgina Wu to discuss her musical journey and to compile a list of her favorite songs.","date":"2015-10-20 14:44:05","author":"Aisha Chabane","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/IMG_35751.jpg","categories":["Blog"],"tags":["alternativerock","choir","georginawu","Guitar","music","piano","spotify"]},{"id":110152,"title":"Girls&#8217; tennis hopes for a break against Los Altos","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/10\/20\/girls-tennis-hopes-for-a-break-against-los-altos\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_110160\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"360\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/IMG_2130.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-110160\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/IMG_2130.jpg\" alt=\"senior [[[\" width=\"360\" height=\"322\" \/><\/a> Senior co-captain Halle Biorn works to improve her serves during practice.

We lose a lot, but get to play the best teams.\u201d\r\n\r\nSenior co-captain Halle Biorn says\u00a0that the Vikings\u00a0have a good chance of defeating Los Altos.\r\n\r\n\u201cLast time we played Los Altos High School, we lost 3-4,\u201d Biorn said. \u201cIt was a really close and intense match. The loss was devastating because we're just as good as Los Altos and we were so close to winning.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe team has been training hard to prepare for the match, according to senior co-captain Kelsey Wang.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have been working on shots that we know Los Altos aren't good at returning,\u201d Biorn said.\r\n\r\nThe match will begin at 3:30 p.m. today at Paly.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School girls\u2019 tennis team (1-8) will face off against Los Altos High School in a match today at home.","date":"2015-10-20 11:00:07","author":"Daniel Li","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/IMG_2130.jpg","categories":["Sports"],"tags":["andy harader","CCS","girls","halle biorn","kelsey wang","los altos","tennis"]}]
