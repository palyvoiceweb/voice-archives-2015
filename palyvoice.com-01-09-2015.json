The wage hike is part of a phased effort to set the minimum wage to $15 by 2018.\r\n\r\nThe decision came nearly four months after the Council\u2019s Policy and Services Committee approved a recommendation to increase the city\u2019s minimum wage, in light of\u00a0several neighboring cities\u2019 adoption of wage hikes.\r\n\r\nSeveral open-forum speakers emphatically advocated for a minimum wage hike, and rebutted the claim that an increase would be devastatingly detrimental to\u00a0businesses.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe dire predictions are wrong,\u201d said Paul George, director of the Peninsula Peace and Justice Center. \"We have an excellent real life example from San Jose ... in the food and hospitality industry, the number of jobs\u00a0increased.\"\r\n\r\nOthers implored\u00a0the council to vote for a\u00a0wage increase\u00a0as a means to combat ever-increasing income inequality.\r\n\r\n\"The rich get richer and the poor get poorer,\" said Andrew Boone, a member of East Palo Alto's Planning Committee. \"There\u2019s no reason not to do it [raise the minimum wage] that I can think of.\"\r\n\r\nA\u00a0few small business owners, however, urged the council to vote against the measure, explaining that\u00a0tip compensation, among other factors, are not considered as part of the current wage.\r\n\r\n\"The minimum wage can\u2019t be looked at as a simple minimum wage,\" Coupa Cafe owner Nancy Coupal said.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"326\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/IMG_9929.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-106124\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/IMG_9929.jpg\" alt=\"Nancy Coupal\" width=\"326\" height=\"217\" \/><\/a> Coupa Cafe owner Nancy Coupal speaks before the Palo Alto City Council on Monday night, insisting against a two dollar minimum wage raise.

Though the council members were supportive of the wage hike, they expressed a desire to explore exceptions regarding\u00a0employee salaries. Councilman Greg Scharff commended the Committee\u2019s gradual approach to raising wages but believes that other wage\u00a0issues should be considered in future discourse.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe should amend the [exempt waitstaff] policy to get where we want to go,\" he said.\r\n\r\nCouncilman Cory Wolbach refuted the claim that teenage workers will be negatively impacted by the wage increase.\r\n\r\n\"'It will hurt teens because they won\u2019t be able to find jobs' is a claim not well supported by economic research,\" he said.\r\n\r\nMayor Karen Holman stated that the potential economic effects on teenagers\u00a0was factored into her decision.\r\n\r\nJunior Haley Chalmers, who works as a lifeguard, does not think the minimum wage increase will impact her job.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think it [the wage increase] is going to affect me, because I already have a job and I get paid more than the minimum wage that it's getting raised to,\" Chalmers said.\r\n\r\nHowever, Chalmers says she thinks the higher minimum wage might make it more difficult for unskilled teenagers without work experience to find jobs.\r\n\r\n\"It will be harder for companies to pay their employees,\" Chalmers said. \"They [businesses] are going to pick people with more experience over teenagers because there will be less job spaces.\"\r\n\r\nMatthew Glickman, a lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, believes that the raise will have a negligible effect on local businesses.\r\n\r\n\"The main thing that classic economics says is supply and demand \u2014 if you make something more expensive, people want less of it,\" Glickman said. \"But in practice, studies have shown that if it [the wage increase] is not a huge difference, not that many jobs disappear... so you probably won't see a big change here.\"","excerpt":"Palo Alto's minimum wage will increase from nine to 11 dollars, effective Jan. 1, 2016, after a unanimous vote by the Palo Alto City Council on Monday night.

Photos by Tolbert Design Architects.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe construction project was initially slated to start in the summer of 2014. But, according to Berkson, it was continually delayed due to issues with the bureaucratic process.\r\n\r\n\"It [the entire construction process] is more than just a handshake,\" Berkson said. \"It's a leaseback \u2014 technically the construction company buys the property from us and then we get it back later. There's a lot of legal work to go through.\"\r\n\r\nThe architecture firm behind the highly anticipated new gym, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tolbertdesignarchitects.com\/#!all-projects\/c1l7f\" target=\"_blank\">Tolbert Design Architects<\/a>, first presented its designs at a Palo Alto Unified School District Board of Education meeting in 2013. The state-of-the-art\u00a0sports complex will be U-shaped, featuring two connected multi-level gyms, a \"Hall of Fame\" corridor, several locker rooms, a concession stand, an athletic store, a dance and yoga room, a ticket booth and a wrestling room. According to Berkson, there may be some minor enhancements to the pool area, such as scoreboards or electrical outlets, but pool facilities will not undergo any major reconstruction.\r\n\r\nAccording to Berkson, assuming that there are no unforeseen changes, the parking lot off of Churchill Avenue will\u00a0remain\u00a0at its\u00a0current parking space\u00a0capacity. It is even possible that several spots by the East side of the gym may open up once it is torn down, Berkson said.\r\n\r\nAlthough it may not look like it from the outside, construction plans are already well underway\u00a0inside the gym. According to Berkson, the construction team disassembled the gym floor, so that pieces of it could be sold at a fundraiser hosted by the Paly Sports Boosters. Also, a HazMat [Hazardous Materials] crew has already removed any hazardous materials from inside the gym, Berkson said.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_106468\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"298\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/MG_8139-cropped.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-106468\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/MG_8139-cropped.jpg\" alt=\"Construction workers work on the water pipes near the Big Gym on Friday afternoon.

Others participated in specialized programs at universities, enriching themselves in debate, theatre, business or music.\r\n\r\nFor 13 Palo Alto High School and Gunn High School students, however, the summer was filled with interviews, hard-hitting questionnaires and mental health awareness within their local community.\r\n\r\nAfter\u00a0a series of teen suicides last year, Paly seniors Christian Leong and Andrew Baer embarked on a five-month journey to capture the effect of mental health issues on their community.\r\n\r\nIn late May, they gathered a team of 13 students, naming themselves \u201cDocumenting our Community about X topics\u201d or the \u201cDocX\u201d team. June marked the creation of their storyboard while July turned their vision into reality \u2014 filming. Five months later, after the release of a trailer\u00a0(see\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-1kPAVxkPmE\">here<\/a>); the team is ready to premiere the entirety of their film at 6:30 p.m. Sept. 12 at the Palo Alto Children\u2019s Theater.\r\n\r\nAccording to Baer, the documentary is a direct response to the teen suicides in Palo Alto, serving as a way to spark conversation between youth and adults, break the stigma around mental health and inspire hope throughout the community.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe want as many people in the community to see the film because it\u2019s really a community issue,\" Baer said. \"It\u2019s not just school or students or teens.\u201d\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_106322\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"355\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/11728994_1615094048747922_522563832245246603_o.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-106322\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/11728994_1615094048747922_522563832245246603_o.jpg\" alt=\"11728994_1615094048747922_522563832245246603_o\" width=\"355\" height=\"355\" \/><\/a> Directors Andrew Baer and Christian Leong work throughout the summer in Baer's house to film and edit their documentary. \"My friend Christian [Leong] and I wanted to take action and make a positive difference,\" Baer said. Photo by Yui Sasajima.[\/caption]The film is a \u201cquasi-documentary,\u201d intertwining a mix of fiction and nonfiction elements, according to Leong.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt gives a backstory of what happened last year,\u201d Leong said. \u201cIt then moves on to what we can do moving forward about the issue while also giving a fictional storyline.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe narrative aspect of the documentary tells the story of a fabricated high school student, \u201cWinston,\u201d played by Paly senior Daniel Cottrell. According to Baer, the character\u2019s setting and personal life remain vague in order to illustrate a relatable character experiencing something difficult.\r\n\r\n\u201cHis\u00a0[Winston's]\u00a0purpose is to provide the emotional aspect of the film that you can\u2019t really get through the documentary,\u201d Baer said.\r\n\r\nThe nonfictional component of the film contains interviews with students, teachers and mental health professionals. Seniors Carolyn Walworth, Bryn Carlson and Leslie Garcia share their stories in each respective interview. Paly math teacher Herb Bocksnick and English teacher Shirley Tokheim voice their opinions as well.\r\n\r\nOther interviews include Supt. Max McGee; Chris Sturgeon, a youth pastor at Menlo Park Presbyterian Church; Dr. Shashank Joshi, a Stanford medical psychologist; and V<span style=\"color: #373e4d;\">assi Johri, D<\/span>irector of health and wellness at\u00a0REACH Ashland Youth Center in San Leandro, which offers support services for teenagers.\r\n\r\nFor the team, the interviews not only provided strong components to the documentary but also added to the filmmakers\u2019 understanding of the topic as a whole.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe whole interview process was also a learning process,\u201d Baer said.\r\n\r\nAccording to Leong, the most difficult aspect of the interviews was dealing with the sensitivity of the topic.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou really have to be careful in the wording when you reach out to different interviewees and as a team,\u201d\u00a0Leong said.\r\n\r\nTo ensure consideration, the filmmakers carefully followed the standardized requirements for filmmaking provided by the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.afsp.org\/\">American Foundation for Suicide Prevention<\/a>, specifically in regards to word choice and glorification, according to Leong.\r\n\r\nThe documentary also cites information, ranging from teenage involvement in community issues to sources of stress,\u00a0that was gathered\u00a0from local high school students through online surveys composed by the filmmakers. Open-ended questions included:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Which of the following causes you stress?<\/li>\r\n\t<li>What is your definition of hope?<\/li>\r\n\t<li>What do you suggest the district do to support teen voice?<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Is teen voice being heard in the community?<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\u201cWe really valued the data because we thought it could give a good sample size of what people in our class really thought of the issue,\u201d Leong said.\r\n\r\nPrior to the creation of \u201cUnmasked,\u201d directors Leong and Baer had separate experiences with filmmaking. Leong took video production courses at Paly and attended a two-week course at Occidental College\u00a0for its School of Creative and Performing Arts. Baer, on the other hand, gained his film expertise through his father, who is involved with\u00a0the filmmaking industry.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust making movies for fun has been something I\u2019ve done,\u201d Baer said.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_106326\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"633\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/11143417_1610557845868209_4430432207647122128_n.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-106326\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/11143417_1610557845868209_4430432207647122128_n.jpg\" alt=\"11143417_1610557845868209_4430432207647122128_n\" width=\"633\" height=\"356\" \/><\/a> Senior Daniel Cottrell plays the role of \"Winston,\" a teenage boy struggling with depression who appears in the fictional part of the documentary.
