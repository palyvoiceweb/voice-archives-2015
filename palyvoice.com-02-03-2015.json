Photo courtesy of the Palo Alto wrestling team.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nNationwide, around 9,000 high school girls wrestled last year, which is nearly nine times more than from a decade earlier, according to the National Wrestling Coaches Association. Although girls' wrestling is growing in numbers, only about three percent of high school wrestlers are girls. Sophomore Sara Aguilar and senior Alexa Austin are the two female\u00a0members of the Palo Alto High School wrestling\u00a0team. The girls compete this weekend at the California Interscholastic Federation girls' state tournament in Visalia. The Paly Voice sat down with the two female wrestlers to ask them about their wrestling experiences at Paly.\r\n\r\n<b>The Paly Voice: <\/b>How did you get interested in wrestling?<b>\u00a0<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>Sara Aguilar<\/b>: Well, I started because at JLS (Jane Lathrop Stanford Middle School), I had Physical Education with Coach Braumon Creighton. He asked me if I wanted to do it, and I just did because it seemed fun.\r\n\r\n<b>Alexa Austin:<\/b> For me, I also was in Mr. Creighton\u2019s class, and he wanted me to join. I thought I was too cool for wrestling, so I didn't. I actually played basketball freshmen year. Then, my mom and I started going to church, and my youth pastor was a wrestler, and he told me to join. I tried it just to try it and liked it, so I stayed.\r\n\r\n<b>TPV: <\/b>What would you suggest for other girls interested in wrestling?\r\n\r\n<b>SA<\/b>: Don't be afraid to try out even if you're the only girl. It is really fun, and you learn a lot. Mentally and physically, you grow.\r\n\r\n<b>AA<\/b>: It really is a fun sport. It might seem scary and intimidating, but it's a really welcoming team. Once you come out, we just like embrace each other.\r\n\r\n<b>TPV: <\/b>How much of a time commitment is it?\r\n\r\n<b>AA<\/b>: Practice is after school every day until 5:30 or 6 p.m. We don't really have any morning practices. Tournaments are on the weekends.\r\n\r\n<b>TPV: <\/b>How do you get on the team?\r\n\r\n<b>SA<\/b>: It's not a cut sport, so that means anyone can try out.\r\n\r\n<b>AA:<\/b> We start conditioning in September. Our first tournament is in December, so we just train for a few months.\r\n\r\n<b>TPV: <\/b>What's your favorite part about wrestling?\r\n\r\n<b>SA<\/b>: Being aggressive (laughs). It's just fun. You get obsessed with it sometimes.\r\n\r\n<b>AA<\/b>: I like competing. In a lot of tournaments, you compete with each other, but once the match is over, you become close friends. A lot of my toughest competitors, I train with a lot in the off season, and we are really close.\r\n\r\n<b>TPV: <\/b>What competitions are big for the girls' team?\r\n\r\n<b>AA<\/b>: A big one for the girls is Napa. Before girls' wrestling was part of the school, that was the state tournament, so we just keep going to it. We usually go to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sbhsd.k12.ca.us\/tournament\">Hollister Baler Bash<\/a>, which is very fun. Its a country tournament with hay bales and stuff like that. We always go to CSS (Central Coast Section) and State. We play in the dual meets, which is our school versus another school. Sometimes we do that in the league finals.\r\n\r\n<b>SA<\/b>: We also go to the boys' tournaments.\r\n\r\n<b>TPV: <\/b>Are there more girl wrestlers now than before?\r\n\r\n<b>AA<\/b>: Girls' wrestling is definitely growing and getting bigger. CCS is a lot bigger this year than it was last year, and it's been growing the three years we have been going. It grows \u2013 people get invited to come and just try it out.\r\n\r\n<em>The girls will attend the weekend-long CIF tournament this weekend at the Visalia Convention Center in Visalia.<\/em>","excerpt":"Sophomore Sara Aguilar and senior Alexa Austin are the two female members of the Palo Alto High School wrestling team.

Max McGee and Paly Principal Kim Diorio to provide students with a platform to express their opinions\u00a0on\u00a0academic and school climate issues. Around 25 students, staff members and parents attended the forum. Students brought up a wide variety of topics as Diorio and McGee listened, focusing on aspects that need improvement as well as recognizing practices that they believe to be successful.\r\n\r\nJunior Unity Club Vice President Siggi Bengston emphasized the lack of support for mental illnesses as a pressing issue on campus.\r\n\r\n\"I think everyone can agree that mental health is a huge issue at this school,\u201d Bengston said. \u201cI know that many people have gone through various forms of mental disorders, but no one talks about it. \u2026 A big issue is that we don't have any guidance on what to do with it.\"\r\n\r\nSenior ASB President Claire Liu expressed her idea that Advisory has the potential to be effective as support for many student issues, including mental health and wellness.\r\n\r\n\u201cAdvisory is and can be extremely powerful,\u201d Liu said. \u201cSome advisers make it as powerful as possible \u2026 but in a usual Advisory with a group of around 25 students, it\u2019s really hard to talk about non-academic topics with your adviser.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents pointed to many other specific systemic issues of the school and the district, providing their own ideas in certain circumstances.\r\n\r\n\u201cI find it very stressful to choose my classes,\u201d sophomore Jordan Schilling said. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to choose when all you get is a paragraph on each course in the course book. I think that instead, there should be something like Club Day so that you can learn more about the courses you are taking.\u201d\r\n\r\nSenior Rachel Segars pointed out that the school lacks focus in providing learning for the sake of gaining knowledge, as she has lost motivation to attend classes as a second semester senior.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_100226\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"350\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/photo-13.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-100226\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/photo-13.jpg\" alt=\"photo 1\" width=\"350\" height=\"263\" \/><\/a> (From left to right) Senior Ellen Shuan, Unity Club President Rachel Segars and Vice President Siggi Bengston express their opinions regarding mental health at Paly alongside Assistant Principal Kathleen Laurence. \"We don't have any guidance on how to deal with it [mental health],\" Bengston (third from left) said. \"It's intimidating to say 'I need help' and 'I feel vulnerable.' We need to have more\u00a0support.\" Photo by Takaaki Sagawa.[\/caption]\u201cOne thing I\u2019ve been kind of thinking to myself as a second semester senior is that I literally have n0 motivation to go to some of my classes,\u201d Segars said. \u201cSome of the classes seem like I\u2019m getting credit just to graduate. ... It would be cool to do something like a project individually or meet with a teacher who knows a lot about the field you want to enter and work [together] on how to broaden our knowledge on that.\u201d\r\n\r\nASB Senior President Maya Ben-Efraim addressed the topic of rigor and grade deflation.\r\n\r\n\u201cSomething that has come up for me is that compared to friends who go to other schools, I feel that I have to work a lot harder to achieve the same thing on the transcript than those friends,\u201d Ben-Efraim said. \u201cAnd when you apply to UCs, I think it\u2019s pretty hard to come from Paly because of that challenge in grades.\u201d\r\n\r\nMany students and staff members agreed on the stigma surrounding laning as well as how early the lanes are assigned.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think it's ridiculous that as a sixth grader, your entire career in mathematics is determined,\u201d sophomore Cezanne Lane said. \u201cIf you are put in a low lane or if you ever drop a lane, it brings up a lot of judgment. ... There [are] even labels like 'dumb' and 'stupid' math.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to McGee, the topics of a recent student forum at Gunn High School overlapped with Paly\u2019s forum in many areas, allowing him to see that the issues were district-wide.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt repeated themes that we heard at Gunn's student forum,\u201d McGee said. \u201cI learned that this is not a Gunn specific issue. \u2026 The idea of stress, the importance of focusing on mental health and wellness \u2014 it's across the district.\u201d\r\n\r\nMcGee said he believes that although low in attendance, the forum sparked significant conversations on district issues.\r\n\r\n\"I really wish there were more students, but what I really liked about the small number of students is that we had more dialogue,\u201d McGee said. \u201cWe really had the opportunity for what I thought were some really meaningful conversations.\u201d","excerpt":"Palo Alto Unified School District administrators hope to cater to students' opinions on several campus and district issues following discussions at a Palo Alto High School student forum on Thursday night in the Media Arts Center.","date":"2015-03-01 12:16:42","author":"Takaaki Sagawa","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/photo-3.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"8496":"ASB","29481":"Cezanne lane","14290":"claire liu","39962":"depressions","8644":"diorio","18368":"forum","8771":"homework","39967":"jordan schilling","39965":"learning","18366":"mac","32445":"max mcgee","30858":"maya ben-efraim","37655":"mental health","39963":"policy","9013":"principal","39966":"rebecca segars","39964":"research","9102":"siggi bengston","9129":"student","39961":"student forum","11606":"superintendent"}},{"id":99222,"title":"SatireDay Cartoon","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/02\/28\/satireday-cartoon\/","content":"<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/satireday-cartoon.jpg\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-99225\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/satireday-cartoon.jpg\" alt=\"satireday cartoon\" width=\"600\" height=\"473\" \/><\/a>","excerpt":"Check out the weekly cartoon.","date":"2015-02-28 09:14:51","author":"Liana Pickrell","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/satireday-cartoon.jpg","categories":["Entertainment","Uncategorized"],"tags":{"39025":"cartoon","8953":"paly","39024":"satireday cartoon"}},{"id":99830,"title":"Preview: Girls&#8217; soccer to play M-A in CCS quarterfinals","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/02\/27\/preview-girls-soccer-to-play-m-a-in-ccs-quarterfinals\/","content":"After a first-round \u00a0bye, the Palo Alto High School girls' soccer team\u00a0(9-2-1, 15-2-1), No. 2 seed, will play No. 7 Menlo-Atherton High School (7-4-3, 11-5-4) in the Central Coast Section quarterfinals this Saturday at Paly.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_100121\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"393\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/IMG_4767.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-100121 \" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/IMG_4767.jpg\" alt=\"Junior forward Heidi Moesner controls the ball in a game against Gunn on Jan. 5.

He provided a lot of offense.\u201d\r\n\r\nDespite losing firepower, Han believes that winning league is a viable goal.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt [the loss of seniors] hasn\u2019t affected us nearly as much as I had anticipated as we\u2019ve had people step up to fill the places that we lost,\u201d Han said. \u201cI\u2019d say winning league is the team goal.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to\u00a0key players, Fukuhara has a similar philosophy of communal strength as he does for the goals of the team.\r\n\r\n\u201cOur [senior] center fielder Phil Lewis has been fantastic, [sophomore] Ben Cleasby stepped up [and] we\u2019ve had [senior] Isaac [Kasevich] step up on the mound,\u201d Fukuhara said. \u201cHopefully it\u2019s a shared role \u2014\u00a0there\u2019s a different star [in] every game.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs the team looks to its\u00a0next game, Fukuhara approaches it with a relaxed mindset.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re just going to come out prepared to play the game of baseball,\u201d Fukuhara said. \u201cJust play hard and hope that we come out on top. That\u2019s all you can do.\u201d\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School baseball team (1-0, 0-0) looks forward to a new season with a new coach, holding high hopes despite graduating nine seniors as it takes on rival Gunn High School at noon tomorrow at home.","date":"2015-02-27 20:31:55","author":"Amy Leung","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/IMG_9918.jpg","categories":["Sports"],"tags":{"8410":"Baseball","17780":"boys baseball","12358":"coach","8912":"new","8944":"palo alto high school","9012":"preview","39703":"season"}},{"id":100136,"title":"Slideshow: Former U.S. Secretary of Energy speaks on energy use, climate change","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/02\/27\/slideshow-former-u-s-secretary-of-energy-speaks-on-energy-use-climate-change\/","content":"Former U.S. Secretary of Energy Steven Chu spoke to students, parents and community members Wednesday night in the Palo Alto High School Media Arts Center during the first installment of the \"Great Minds at Campus\" speaker series.
