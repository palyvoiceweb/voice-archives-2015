Many of these efforts will be put into effect this school year, such as having a homework-free February break with no tests allowed on the following Tuesday and Wednesday; allowing flexibility when it comes to test and assignment scheduling due to the impact of the recent Henry M. Gunn High School student death by suicide; and proposing a number of minimum days for students, providing the staff with time to discuss homework policies and mindfulness training.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_97201\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"350\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/IMG_0472.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-97201\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/IMG_0472.jpg\" alt=\"Paly Principal Kim Diorio stands outside of the Tower Building.

Diorio and ASB worked to create a list of ways to reduce academic stress and improve the school climate. Photo by George Lu.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAfter the recent tragedy, Diorio felt that now was especially the time to begin implementing these ideas\u00a0instead of keeping them on the back burner.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe started having these conversations a year and a half ago, and we want people to understand this is not a knee jerk reaction,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cWe want to take action. We know this is an issue on our campus.\u201d\r\n\r\nDiorio understands that while these changes cannot solve the problem of mental health issues, she hopes that this will help alleviate unnecessary stress.\r\n\r\n\u201cRecognizing that suicide is an extremely complex mental health issue, we [the administration] acknowledge that academic \u2018stress is a problem, but not <i>the <\/i>problem,\u2019 as one Gunn student described for our community,\u201d Diorio said in the letter. \u201cHowever, we do have the power to take small steps to reduce stress and create opportunities for students to take a well-deserved break from the daily grind.\u201d\r\n\r\nOther possible structural modifications described in the letter will begin to be executed during the 2015-16 school year. These suggestions include working with the Education Council to create homework-free nights or weekends; preventing students from having more than two tests a day or allowing more freedom to reschedule tests; and having no major tests or projects due on seven-period C days.\r\n\r\nDiorio wanted to revise the C day schedule, particularly in response to recent feedback from parents, students and staff. Over 80 percent of parents and students stated their dislike of C days in the survey, but some teachers appreciate some aspects of having all seven periods in one day.\r\n\r\n\u201cSome teachers really like to have contact with students three days a week, so we decided we can keep C days but [to] change them,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous to spend all day Saturday and Sunday prepping for a C day. [With the new plan], there just wouldn\u2019t be heavy work for a C day \u2013 it\u2019d be more of a review day. We can also make a C day a minimum day, and then the teachers can stay and talk about homework.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents look forward to a changed C day schedule.\r\n\r\n\"[Changing]\u00a0C days would be beneficial because it would decrease the amount of homework assigned over the weekend,\u201d junior Sophie Swezey said. \u201cIt's also very difficult to get through seven classes in a day, and I feel like shorter periods are considerably less productive than block periods.\"\r\n\r\nDiorio also said she hopes that this letter will help promote increased discussion between students and teachers.\r\n\r\nStudents appreciate the sentiments the administration has been showing and acknowledge the support the school has been giving them during this difficult time.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think it [the letter] sounded really genuine and [that] things will get set in motion,\u201d senior Daryl Dillahunty said. \u201cI think when this [a death] happened before, nothing was really done and nothing was changed. I feel like now, there are plans being made and something will actually change. The students' feelings are really being taken into account, and our stress is finally being validated.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe letter also included a <a href=\"http:\/\/goo.gl\/AzyDmF\" target=\"_blank\">Google survey form<\/a>, which will allow students to provide feedback and suggestions about ways to improve the school climate and reduce stress.\r\n\r\nDiorio hopes to create a safe, supportive environment for students.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe want high school to be fun for you,\u201d Diorio said in the letter. \u201cWe want high school to be a place where you learn and grow. \u2026 We want high school to be a place where you feel your teachers and our entire staff care about you. We want you to know that you matter and you have a voice.\u201d\r\n\r\nDiorio emphasized the importance of students' well-being, not just their academic success.\r\n\r\n\u201cLet\u2019s take time and put our lesson plans aside and focus on what\u2019s important,\u201d Diorio said.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>*Editor's note: Since the publishing of this article, the letter that Diorio wrote has been taken down from paly.net.<\/em>","excerpt":"In a letter addressed to students, Palo Alto High School Principal Kim Diorio and the Associated Student Body described ways to reduce academic stress and expressed support for the Paly community.","date":"2015-01-30 13:47:57","author":"Alex Merkle-Raymond","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/IMG_0472.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"33934":"c day","27706":"changes","8644":"diorio","8751":"gunn","37742":"letter","28773":"monday","8944":"palo alto high school","8953":"paly","29302":"schedule"}},{"id":96904,"title":"Voice Q&#038;A: Journalism teacher Wojcicki introduces new book","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/01\/29\/voice-qa-journalism-teacher-wojcicki-introduces-new-book\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_96921\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"536\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Screen-Shot-2015-01-26-at-10.21.12-PM.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-96921\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Screen-Shot-2015-01-26-at-10.21.12-PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-01-26 at 10.21.12 PM\" width=\"536\" height=\"298\" \/><\/a> Paly journalism teacher Esther Wojcicki speaks about her book \"Moonshots in Education: Blended Learning in the Classroom\u201d on Jan. 24 in the Jewish Community Center.\u00a0Wojcicki's\u00a0book describes\u00a0her\u00a0goal to change the culture within\u00a0classrooms.

She also believes that\u00a0integrating technology will help to create an enjoyable classroom environment where students can thrive.\r\n\r\nWojcicki hopes that other teachers will adopt her methodology for changing the classroom set-up.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy idea is to give other teachers ideas for how they can do the same thing in the classrooms,\u201d Wojcicki said in an interview with The Paly Voice.\r\n\r\n<strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The Paly Voice:\u00a0<\/span>Could you give us a brief description of your book?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nWojcicki: It is basically how to teach [and] how to change the culture of a classroom. [It\u2019s] how to teach 21st century skills without lecturing to students. The reason it\u2019s called \u201cMoonshots in Education\u201d is because it takes a tremendous amount of energy and conviction to actually do it. I think it\u2019s even harder than a moonshot, because teachers don\u2019t typically want to change the culture of their classroom.\r\n\r\n<strong>TPV: What inspiration did you have for writing the book?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nWojcicki:\u00a0The main inspiration are my classes and my students, because over the years I see what a difference it [the journalism program] can make in the lives of students. And not just while they\u2019re in my class, but after they graduate from high school and even after they graduate from college. Many of them come back and tell me that this [journalism] was the single most important class they ever took. So then I thought, maybe I should share this with other teachers. What am I doing that is so unusual? So I had to go back and look at what I was doing to try and understand what was so unusual about it, because I didn\u2019t really know at that point.\r\n\r\n<strong><strong>TPV:\u00a0<\/strong>How have your ideas on blended learning influenced how you teach in the classroom?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nWojcicki:\u00a0In most of my classes, I do more than the average project-based learning. \u2026 The reason I adopted blended learning is because it\u2019s a movement that says that approximately 50 percent of the class time should be devoted to the [project-based] collaborative work while the other 50 percent of the time is devoted to lecturing.\r\n\r\n<strong><strong>TPV:\u00a0<\/strong>What is your favorite part about teaching journalism?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nWojcicki:\u00a0Well, first of all, my favorite part is the students. ... Every year they are different and I learn a lot from being in the classroom with them. A journalist is supposed to be able to be the first one to tell everyone what\u2019s going on. So if more people can get information and analyze it correctly and think about it, the whole society will be better off. I think journalism is the best training that a student can have.\r\n\r\n<strong><strong>TPV:\u00a0<\/strong>Where can we buy the book?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nWojcicki:\u00a0It [the first round] is already sold out, but it should be on Amazon. Also they\u2019re bringing in 200 copies at the JCC for purchase. Also, there will be a Kindle version if anyone wants to read it in that form.\r\n\r\n<strong><strong>TPV:\u00a0<\/strong>What would you say your favorite publication at Paly is?<\/strong>\r\n\r\nWojcicki:\u00a0That\u2019s like asking who\u2019s your favorite child ... It\u2019s hard for me to say. They\u2019re all great. I hope no one will get offended that I didn\u2019t pick them.","excerpt":"The Paly Voice sat down with Palo Alto High School journalism teacher Esther Wojcicki to discuss her book \u201cMoonshots in Education: Blended Learning in the Classroom.\u201d","date":"2015-01-29 19:27:18","author":"Adele Bloch","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Screen-Shot-2015-01-26-at-10.21.12-PM.png","categories":["Features","Spotlight"],"tags":{"37647":"book","12704":"esther wojcicki","37714":"jcc","8814":"journalism","37646":"Moonshots in Education","37645":"Woj"}},{"id":96258,"title":"Hungry?

Photo by Lydia Barry.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe College Board charged $89 per test in 2014, but many schools added on a sum of money to cover supplies needed to administer the test. With tests costing $115 in 2014, Paly collected an extra $26 per test.\r\n\r\nSome of that money went to funding AP testing-related resources such as proctors and supplies. However, data provided by Paly administrators revealed that the school had a remaining sum of money from the AP tests and that those excess funds were used to buy a range of general school supplies such as dry erase markers for classrooms and technical equipment not directly related to the AP tests themselves.\r\n\r\nThe numbers recorded by the Paly administration in the schools testing fund for the 2014 AP tests were:<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/photo2.jpg\">\r\n<\/a>\r\n\r\n<em>Collected testing fees: $159,438.58<\/em>\r\n\r\n<em>Cost of exams: $112,707<\/em>\r\n\r\n<em>Proctors: $17,719.52<\/em>\r\n\r\n<em>Additional fees*: $4,063.68<\/em>\r\n\r\nThat results in $24,948.38\u00a0leftover after proctors and additional fees had been paid for. With the amount of money paid per test in 2014 at Paly, the school could have charged $105 per test and still have had money remaining.\r\nFor this spring, the College Board increased the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/apstudent.collegeboard.org\/takingtheexam\/exam-fees\">testing cost<\/a> to $91, meaning Paly will make $14 per test instead of last years $26.\r\n\r\nPaly administration will not know exactly how much extra money it has until all tests have been paid for and taken, and risks losing money with its lowered cost, but its new cost of $105 per test will still be higher than most Bay Area schools.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Screen-Shot-2015-01-27-at-2.03.25-PM.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-96929 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/Screen-Shot-2015-01-27-at-2.03.25-PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-01-27 at 2.03.25 PM\" width=\"652\" height=\"320\" \/><\/a>\r\n\r\nMany students were unaware of the additional cost charged to them in 2014, and do not believe the school should have been able to use AP testing funds for things unrelated to the test themselves.\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to know beforehand if what I am paying is partially a donation,\" senior Conner Harden said. \"Palo Alto schools should only make the students\u00a0in AP classes pay the bare minimum for the cost of the test. If a student likes, they can donate money to the school, but not without being notified.\"\r\n\r\nParents, who generally pay for AP tests for their students, were surprised by the additional charge of an AP test and do not believe the schools should continue to overcharge them.\r\n\r\n\"With so many years of data, Paly and Gunn should be able to forecast these expenses fairly accurately,\" Paly alumni parent Liz Raffel said. \"There's really no excuse for excess profits in the amounts mentioned, and it's just wrong for AP test-takers to be funding, unknowingly, general supplies for the entire school.\"\r\n\r\nAnother Paly alumni parent, Katharine Glazier, echoes Raffel's sentiments.\r\n\r\n\"It seems that the school has unfairly made a nice bit of money off the backs of the AP students and their parents,\" Glazier said.\r\n\r\nAP test takers are appreciative that the administration has made the effort to lower the cost following last year's dramatic over-charge.\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't okay for them to overcharge us, but I'm glad the administration has realized its mistake and has decided to lower the cost,\" senior\u00a0Olivia Johnson said. \"For students taking AP tests, this will make a difference.\"\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em>*Additional fees include custodial staff costs during AP testing, testing supplies such as snacks, tech support, headphones for listening portions of certain AP tests and AP Conference costs (teachers attend training before they can teach an AP course).\u00a0<\/em>","excerpt":"Paly administration lowers the cost per AP test for the 2014-15 school year.

According to the American Association for Community Colleges, smaller classroom sizes are a major benefit for community college students.

However, in a city where schooling and success\u00a0are viewed as one, educational\u00a0alternatives such as community college are sometimes seen as second-rate or last resort options.\r\n\r\nDue to the perceived notion that community colleges are inherently inferior to four-year universities, a stigma has arisen for those who opt for this option.\r\n\r\n\u201cSome people at Paly [Palo Alto High School] will look down on you if you say you\u2019re going to a community college,\u201d sophomore Jacky Moore said. \u201cThey might automatically assume that you weren\u2019t smart enough to get into a four-year university.\u201d\r\n\r\nHowever, this belief is both offensive and often inaccurate. Approximately 99 percent of all community college associate degree enrollees have received either a high school diploma or passed a General Education Development test, according to the <a href=\"http:\/\/ccrc.tc.columbia.edu\/Community-College-FAQs.html\">Community College Resource Center<\/a>. In fact, an October 2014 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sociologicalscience.com\/articles-vol1-25-448\/\">study<\/a>\u00a0conducted by three UCLA professors concluded that attending junior college actually increases disadvantaged students\u2019 likelihood of eventually receiving a bachelor\u2019s degree at a four-year university. According to the American Association of Community Colleges, 45 percent of undergraduate students enrolled in a four-year college in the 2012-13 school year originally went to a two-year public college. The sum of this information\u00a0defies the stigma that most community college students are\u00a0unintelligent.\r\n\r\nJunior colleges and universities also may be acknowledged incorrectly\u00a0as extremely dissimilar. Although most community colleges award only associate degrees to graduates instead of bachelor\u2019s degrees, students can easily transfer to universities once they have completed junior college. Also, while community colleges usually put\u00a0a greater emphasis on vocational fields compared to universities, both offer degrees in a large variety of fields.\r\n\r\nCommunity colleges offer additional benefits when compared to four-year colleges. According to AACC, community college tuition rates are approximately 50 percent cheaper than four-year universities. Smaller classroom sizes, superb student support services and the sheer number of available programs are all <a href=\"http:\/\/uhcc.hawaii.edu\/promo\/top10Reasons.php\">extra advantages<\/a>, according to the University of Hawaii Community Colleges. Community colleges may also appeal to high school graduates who are not prepared to move across the state or country\u00a0to attend college or are unsure of which career path they wish to take.\r\n\r\nPaly College Adviser Sandra Cernobori is one of many junior college advocates.\r\n\r\n\"I think [community colleges] are great options, not only to prepare to transfer [or] to get career training, but also they're economical and have excellent reputations,\" she said.\r\n\r\nCurrent United States Secretary of Education Arne Duncan also declared his support for community colleges during a question and answer <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mlive.com\/education\/index.ssf\/2011\/11\/education_secretary_arne_dunca.html\">session<\/a> through Facebook in 2011.\r\n\r\n\u201cCommunity colleges, I continue to believe, have this ability to transform young people\u2019s lives, adults\u2019 lives, older people\u2019s lives in very profound ways,\u201d he said during the session.\r\n\r\nDespite these distinct benefits, attending a community college is still often looked down upon in Palo Alto. An informal\u00a0survey conducted by The Paly Voice on 110 current and past Paly students in late January showed that nearly 93 percent of those surveyed believe that some stigma exists regarding the attendance of a community college. Only approximately 7.2 percent, or eight students, were unsure or stated that they do not believe a stigma exists in Palo Alto.\r\n\r\nThese results bring up an important question: How should we address this widespread\u00a0issue at Paly?\r\n\r\nSophomore Tara Madhav says\u00a0that awareness will help slow the prevalence of the stigma.\r\n\r\n\u201cPeople should become more aware of the options out there for college-bound seniors,\u201d Madhav\u00a0said. \u201cCommunity colleges should [also] spread awareness about all they have to offer.\u201d\r\n\r\nWe as students can also help end this stigma simply by offering support to others\u2019 decisions in regards to their own education. It is imperative to understand that our definition of educational success may contrast greatly with that of our peers. Recognizing that one\u2019s high school GPA is one of countless factors taken into account when applying to college is a step in the right direction. Teachers and counselors should also encourage students to look beyond the stigma and check out academic pathways at universities as well as local community colleges.","excerpt":"In Palo Alto, educational alternatives such as community college are sometimes seen as second-rate or last resort options.
