The debaters received professional coaching and have been practicing for weeks to perfect their cases, according to Savage.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, freshman Tanay Krishna won the novice division of the Western Novice National Championships, continuing Paly\u2019s history of victory at the tournament.\r\n\r\nAccording to Savage, success at the tournament last weekend was due to the hard work of the debaters and coaching staff, the help of varsity debaters for additional coaching and the supportive nature of the team. The performance of the debaters was impressive due to the level of competition at the tournament, Savage said.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Western States Novice and JV Championship drew the top beginning and intermediate debaters from the Western Region of the US, so competition was extremely fierce,\u201d Savage said. \u00a0\u201cIn addition, the tournament was twice the size it has been in years past, so it was much more difficult to reach elimination rounds.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlthough the team is highly accomplished, Savage is proud of her team's progress\u00a0in and out of competition.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe often say that our team is 49% about speech and debate and 51% about life,\u201d Savage said. \u201cWe are exceptionally successful in competition, but our greatest strength and achievement is how bonded we are as a team and how we pull together as a family.\u201d\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School Speech and Debate team is continuing an impressive season after winning the Western Novice National Championships for the third consecutive year.

SciOly\u00a0competitions are similar to golf in that teams try\u00a0to get as low a score as possible. Winning all 23 events would give a team 23 points in total, which is the lowest possible score.\r\n\r\n\u201cOur success this year is primarily due to an accumulation of experience in engineering events, where we've stumbled in the past,\u201d Lu said. \u201cIn addition, this is the first year that we've had such a high number of upperclassmen on the team. ... Their\u00a0experience and dedication is definitely something that has impacted the performance of the team.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Lu, Paly had ten first-place finishes and averaged between second and third for the other events.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis year was our best overall performance but not really our biggest landslide victory,\u201d Lu said.\r\n\r\nLast year, the <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/03\/27\/science-olympiad-wins-regional-competition-heads-to-states\/\" target=\"_blank\">team won Regionals<\/a> but <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/04\/17\/science-olympiad-places-second-at-state-competition\/\" target=\"_blank\">came in second<\/a> at States to rival Mira Loma High School. According to junior Sylvia Targ, Paly has lost to Mira Loma at States every year for the past ten years except in 2013, when Paly advanced to Nationals and came in <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2013\/05\/21\/paly-scioly-team-makes-impressive-debut-at-nationals\/\" target=\"_blank\">16th\u00a0place<\/a> overall.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis year, we are really gunning for Nationals, and we think that we have a good shot,\" Targ said.\u00a0\"We\u2019re all super excited and so incredibly motivated.\u00a0We always have each other\u2019s backs because we know how stressful this is. It\u2019s just really fun to succeed with people you care about that much, so it [Regionals] was a really good day.\u201d","excerpt":"After placing first out of 25 teams at the Santa Clara Regional Science Olympiad competition on March 14, the Palo Alto High School Science Olympiad team will attend the state competition on April 18 in Turlock, Calif.","date":"2015-03-20 10:38:33","author":"Julia Asin","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/11059646_10205104634192735_5356398396971996938_n.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":{"39735":"alex lu","12848":"competition","8944":"palo alto high school","14166":"paly scioly","40816":"regionals","10667":"santa clara","40921":"santa clara regionals","9074":"science olympiad","10045":"scioly","33011":"states","33475":"sylvia targ"}},{"id":101257,"title":"Liveblog: Softball vs. Santa Clara","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/03\/19\/liveblog-softball-vs-santa-clara\/","content":"Check back here this Friday, March 20, for live coverage of the Palo Alto High School softball team (6-4, 0-1) as it hosts the Santa Clara Bruins (2-4, 0-0) in search of its first El Camino League win of the season.
