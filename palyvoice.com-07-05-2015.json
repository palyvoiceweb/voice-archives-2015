The boys have become a much deeper team, which bodes well for their championship meets.\r\n\r\n\u201cSome of our guys to watch for in the next weeks are sophomores Ethan Bundy and Alex Liang, juniors Andrew Cho, Matthew Liang, Robert Cheng and Daniel Sing and seniors Oliver Tucher, William Shin, Winston Wang and Ryan Drover,\u201d Drover said.\r\n\r\nIn addition, senior and captain for girls' swimming, Sarah Putulin, is proud that the girls' are going into league championships undefeated.\r\n\r\n\u201cI'm so proud of the girls for what they've accomplished and I can't wait to see them swim really fast at at Leagues [Championships] and CCS [Central Coast Sectionals],\u201d Putulin said.\r\n\r\nAs many girls on the swim team have begun tapering, Putulin is excited for the time drops that are likely to come with it.\r\n\r\n\u201cI'm very confident that we'll win Leagues [Championships] and that we'll place top 5 at CCS, \" Putulin said. \u201cWe have the talent and the depth to pull through. In addition, we have a fast and young team and I know we'll do great.\u201d\r\n\r\nLeague Championships will take place at 4 p.m\u00a0on Wednesday, May 6 for the girls and Thursday, May 7 for the boys at\u00a0Saratoga High School.","excerpt":"As the swim season comes to a strong close, the Palo Alto High School boys' and girls' swim team will compete at SCVAL Championships this week.\r\n","date":"2015-05-06 19:23:38","author":"Daniel Li","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/Screen-Shot-2015-05-02-at-2.41.45-AM.png","categories":["Sports","Spotlight"],"tags":{"8568":"CCS","15411":"leagues","8944":"palo alto high school","8953":"paly","40102":"ryan drover","40100":"sarah putulin","9143":"Swimming"}},{"id":103687,"title":"Liveblog: Boys&#8217; lacrosse takes Mountain View tonight for Senior Night","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/05\/06\/liveblog-boys-lacrosse-takes-mountain-view-tonight-for-senior-night\/","content":"<span style=\"color: #000000;\">The Palo Alto High School boys\u2019 lacrosse team (15-9-1, 4-6) will take on the Mountain View High School Spartans (15-11, 5-3) at 7 p.m. tonight at the Paly lacrosse field.

According to Bowers, Paly will not have gyms or pools during the construction process.\r\n\r\n\u201cFor 18 months we\u2019re going to have to find practice space for every indoor team and our aquatic teams,\u201d Bowers said. \u201cThat means you have to find [space\/facilities] and get to practice everyday and find a place to play. \u2026 All of that stuff will be an added challenge.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn addition, Bowers has several other goals which she will be addressing in the next school year.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m also looking to increase student involvement [in athletics] a little bit more,\u201d she said. \u201cNot necessarily [just] with athletes but in other roles. I\u2019d like the Sports Careers class to get involved in things like [becoming] information directors, announcers or working with trainers \u2014 looking for places for kids who aren\u2019t on sports teams to still be involved in the program in a variety of ways.\u201d\r\n\r\nBowers also says she wants to bridge the gap between the athletic and educational aspects of school.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy other goal is to strengthen the partnership between athletics and academics,\u201d Bowers said. \u201cI think sometimes they exist in parallel universes and I\u2019d like to see more overlap between them.\u201d\r\n\r\nAfter the construction project is concluded, Bowers hopes to improve communication between the athletic department and the rest of the school.\r\n\r\n\"I believe we could just really tap into their [students'] strengths or to improve the communication between sports, the publication, the newspaper, the teachers on campus, everything,\" Bowers said.\r\n\r\nAccording to Bowers, her experience as a math teacher and sports team coach will help her achieve these goals.\r\n\r\nBowers will teach one math class next year, but will budget 80 percent of her time for her responsibilities as athletic director. She says one of her concerns is the transition\u00a0to spending significantly less time teaching.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy biggest worry about the job is that I\u2019m going to miss the classroom because I\u2019ve been doing it for 27 years,\u201d Bowers said. \u201cThat\u2019s partially why I wanted to teach at least one class because I don\u2019t want to leave that connection behind.\u201d","excerpt":"Palo Alto High School math teacher Kathi Bowers will replace Jason Fung as the new athletic director beginning in the 2015-16 school year.","date":"2015-05-05 17:48:17","author":"Emily Hwang","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/11186372_679132575547270_1565870167_n.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"12357":"athletic director","43484":"athletics","43482":"bowers","43483":"fung","23905":"goals","8753":"gym","43552":"jason","43481":"kathi","8871":"math","8944":"palo alto high school","8953":"paly","9120":"sports"}},{"id":102903,"title":"Palo Alto opens nation&#8217;s first all-inclusive park","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/05\/04\/palo-alto-opens-nations-first-all-inclusive-park\/","content":"As children, most people don't thinks twice about their\u00a0abilities to run around on play structures or glide through the air on swings.

Photo by Emilia Diaz-Magaloni.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nHowever, this month, Palo Alto introduced a revolutionary new park completely inclusive to all individuals. The Magical Bridge Playground drew a large crowd during its grand opening on April 18 at Mitchell Park and included performances by differently abled children on the community stage.\r\n\r\nAccording to Jill Asher, co-creator of the playground, outdoor play is an essential way for young children to develop gross motor skills and to form friendships.\r\n\r\nThe idea began when Olenka Villarreal, a Palo Alto mom, could not take her child with special needs to any of the 34 parks in Palo Alto. Instead, Villarreal was forced to spend $150 an hour on a round-trip to San Jose so that her daughter could simply swing on a special swing set, Asher said.\r\n\r\nDespite Villarreal's complaints to the City of Palo Alto regarding the lack of inclusivity in the city parks, all city parks were compliant with the requirements of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ada.gov\/\">Americans with Disabilities Act.<\/a> An ADA-compliant park gives differently abled children the ability to enter the park, but not necessarily the ability to play in it. Villarreal soon decided to make matters into her own hands.\r\n\r\nAfter six years of extensive planning and nine months of building, Villarreal utilized $4 million raised through fundraising and the $300,000 given by the City of Palo Alto to finally turn her dream into a reality.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt truly is a playground for everybody regardless of physical and cognitive disabilities or abilities,\u201d Asher said.\r\n\r\nAccording to Nick Peterson, head contractor of the project, the park is separated into seven different zones: the kindness corner, picnic\/playhouse zone, slide zone, music zone, swinging\/sway zone, spinning zone and tot zone.\r\n\r\nAccording to Peterson, the inclusion experts and contractors have been working hard to make sure every structure and surface is inclusive to all cognitive and physical disabilities. For example, every inch of the park is covered in a special surface that is wheelchair-friendly, making it easier for all children to get around the park.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_102943\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"215\"]<img class=\"wp-image-102943\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/04\/11185441_840578059351617_467290310_n.jpg\" alt=\"11185441_840578059351617_467290310_n\" width=\"215\" height=\"287\" \/> This is one of the 'magical bridges' in the Magical Bridge park.
