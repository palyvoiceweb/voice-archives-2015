The social media site with over 1.39 billion users introduced this new feature on Feb. 25 to\u00a0offer\u00a0support to\u00a0individuals dealing with depression. Screenshot by Alex Merkle-Raymond.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nIn this article, we discuss both the pros and cons of such a feature.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n\r\n<em>Student opinion:\u00a0<\/em>I think it's a good thing, because there are a lot of people who post statuses that\u00a0I don't feel comfortable commenting on, but I can tell something is going on,\" senior Jack Brook said. \"It's good that you can do this anonymously without feeling awkward.\"\r\n\r\n<strong>1. It's anonymous<\/strong>.\u00a0Many\u00a0Facebook users have hundreds of\u00a0Facebook friends, many of whom may simply be acquaintances.\u00a0However, the anonymity of this\u00a0notification allows all Facebook friends to reach out to those who may be in pain, regardless\u00a0of how close the two individuals are to one another.\r\n\r\n<strong>2.\u00a0<\/strong><strong>There are options.<\/strong>\u00a0The new service not only attempts to help the potentially suicidal individual, but it also offers help to the user who reports the post, because, according to Facebook, \"it's important for you to feel supported, too.\" Due to this belief,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0presents the user with the ability to reach out to a friend, chat with a trained helper or\u00a0even\u00a0find nearby counseling services.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. It shows you care.<\/strong>\u00a0It is initially a Facebook friend who voices a sign of concern to the potentially suicidal individual. When the suicidal person receives a Facebook notification stating that someone believes they are in distress, the notification has the ability to make\u00a0the\u00a0suicidal person feel loved and cared for.\r\n\r\n<strong>4. Difficult situations are placed in the hands of professionals.<\/strong>\u00a0Often, many friends and family members are simply not equipped to handle a suicidal situation and they may become overwhelmed. The tools Facebook provide, however, aim to direct suicidal individuals to trained resources and facilities that know how to properly handle such a situation.\r\n\r\n<strong>5. Better safe than sorry.\u00a0<\/strong>Is there really any harm in\u00a0reaching out\u00a0to someone who is potentially upset? Often people just want to know that they are not alone and\u00a0that they\u00a0have support. This notification service assists\u00a0in doing so.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n\r\n<em>Student opinion<\/em>: \"It's a terrible thing,\" sophomore Johnny Rohrbach said. \"It's a complete invasion of privacy. I think you should be able to express yourself freely without people recommending a psychiatrist to you. If you want help, you should be able to seek it out yourself.\"\r\n\r\n<strong>1. It can be abused.<\/strong> Just like any other feature on Facebook,\u00a0this feature could\u00a0easily be used as a joke. Any status could theoretically be\u00a0reviewed, soon turning\u00a0this feature as a new way to \"poke\" friends.\u00a0The service could be overwhelmed with\u00a0false\u00a0requests, making it easy for researchers to\u00a0overlook any real inquiries.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. It's an invasion of privacy.\u00a0<\/strong>Many see\u00a0Facebook as a personal space for\u00a0sharing\u00a0posts, photos and information to friends. Giving users\u00a0the ability to report a post, even if it is to be reviewed by professionals, is an invasion of privacy for those who want to keep their posts within their friend group. On top of this,\u00a0a professional who\u00a0knows nothing about the potentially suicidal individual shouldn't be allowed to deem a Facebook post suicidal if that person\u00a0has absolutely\u00a0no background on the individual.\r\n\r\n<b>3. It's limited.<\/b> This feature only works for people who post\u00a0<em>statuses.<\/em>\u00a0If someone posts a picture or shares a wall post, this same feature would\u00a0not be available.\r\n\r\n<strong>4. It is difficult to access.\u00a0<\/strong>To initially report a status, one must click on \"I don't like this post,\" then \"I think it shouldn't be on Facebook,\" then \"I think they might hurt themselves,\" and finally \"It's hurtful, threatening or suicidal.\" It takes many clicks to report such a post and it can often be difficult to decide which of the multiple choice options is most suitable for the post. The complexity of the reporting process may deter users from reporting potentially harmful posts.\r\n\r\n<b>5. It\u00a0can make people feel uncomfortable.<\/b>\u00a0Because some people utilize\u00a0Facebook as a public journal\u00a0or blog, there may be Facebook statuses with emotional\u00a0content.\u00a0Thus, some Facebook users may report these posts\u00a0as\u00a0a cry for help. The report may\u00a0offend the original Facebook user who simply wanted to record his or her\u00a0feelings. It may also lead them to change their posting behavior in the future.","excerpt":"This article discusses the pros and cons of a new Facebook feature, which seeks to share online resources for suicidal individuals, by allowing Facebook users to report a friend's post as \"hurtful, threatening or suicidal.\"","date":"2015-03-06 15:21:58","author":"Alex Merkle-Raymond","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/Screen-Shot-2015-02-26-at-1.31.19-PM.png","categories":["Editor's Pick","Opinion"],"tags":{"40127":"cons","8689":"Facebook","40123":"Facebook feature","40132":"facebook update","10751":"jack brook","34226":"johnny rohrbach","8944":"palo alto high school","8953":"paly","8964":"paly voice","9011":"prevention","40128":"privacy","40126":"pros","40125":"pros and cons","40129":"suicidal","9135":"suicide","9136":"Suicide prevention","40124":"university of washington","38450":"update"}},{"id":100774,"title":"B day schedule on March 9, no school on March 13","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/03\/05\/no-school-on-friday-march-13\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2015-03-05 21:45:31","author":"Lizzie Chun","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":{"40207":"b day","40205":"break","40206":"day off","32534":"holiday","33935":"schedule change"}},{"id":100651,"title":"Robotics team to compete at regional competition","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/03\/05\/robotics-team-to-compete-at-regional-competition\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_100723\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"378\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/11045754_1605464913003074_623212239_o.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-100723\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/11045754_1605464913003074_623212239_o.jpg\" alt=\"The Palo Alto High School robotics team completed constructing its robot last week.

We've never scored well there [but] they did what they needed to do.\"\r\n\r\nAfter winning a second consecutive\u00a0Santa Clara Valley Athletic League title last season, the boys' golf team set even loftier goals this season\u00a0with three\u00a0key freshman additions. Hwang highlighted the potential he sees in the team this year as central\u00a0to this year's success.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #373e4d;\">\"We've been pretty good lately, winning our division the last three years and league the last two years,\" Hwang said. \"I think we definitely have a shot to move past CCS to NorCals for the maybe first time ever.\" Last year, the\u00a0team was\u00a0knocked out in the first round of CCS.<\/span>\r\n\r\nFellow senior captain John\u00a0Knowles added that high\u00a0expectations for returning players and incoming freshmen\u00a0should adequately diminish the big\u00a0losses of graduated seniors Patrick Fuery and Sam Niethammer.\r\n\r\n\"The k<span style=\"color: #373e4d;\">ey to the upcoming season are two new talented\u00a0freshmen, Ahmed Ali and Joon-Sung Ha,\" Knowles\u00a0said. \"<\/span>Also, [returning juniors] Henry Gordon and Matt Lewis have gotten a lot better and so, under the watchful gaze of\u00a0our great coach [Knight], we expect to go far.\"\r\n\r\nKnight especially\u00a0underlined\u00a0how well the new freshmen\u00a0are adjusting to high school golf.\r\n\r\n\"[The team has] three new freshmen, two [Ali and Ha] right now are our number one and two in terms of averages,\" Knight said. \"[The] third freshman did really well when we played Valley Christian [last Tuesday] ... He isn't quite as talented as the other two yet, but he's showing a lot of promise.\"\r\n\r\nThe team's next league match\u00a0will be against Fremont High School at 3 p.m. on Thursday at Sunnyvale Municipal Golf Course.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"After winning a second consecutive Santa Clara Valley Athletic League title, the Palo Alto High School boys' golf team sets even loftier goals with three key freshman additions.","date":"2015-03-03 22:28:13","author":"Wesley Woo","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/11024953_10206069050267994_1790611489_o.jpg","categories":["Golf","Sports"],"tags":{"40009":"boys' golf","40011":"freshman on golf","40012":"freshmen on golf","8738":"Golf","40010":"golf 2015","32704":"homestead","14521":"paly golf","12045":"season preview"}},{"id":100454,"title":"Season preview: Boys\u2019 lacrosse uncertain yet optimistic about future","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/03\/03\/season-preview-boys-lacrosse-uncertain-yet-optimistic-about-future\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_100455\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"620\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/IMG_0003.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-100455\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/IMG_0003.jpg\" alt=\"Senior midfielder Owen Staiger prepares to throw the ball.

Photo by Emma Chiu.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAmidst the deficit\u00a0of 14 seniors and the loss of dominant private schools in its league, the Palo Alto High School boys' lacrosse team (1-0, 0-0) is teetering on the brink of success as it adjusts to new team dynamics.\r\n\r\nAs the Vikings take on Sacred Heart Prep at 7 p.m. Thursday at home, they entertain\u00a0high hopes\u00a0after defeating Archbishop Mitty High School, 12-10 in a non-league game. Sophomore Hayden Libbey said the game was challenging, and required a strong effort.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was a pretty hard-fought game,\u201d Libbey said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have many players in total, so it was a lot of running for all of us.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith this win under the belt, head coach DJ Shelton predicts the team dynamic to change, as the team is no longer so senior-heavy.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was definitely a veteran group that had carried the program,\u201d Shelton said.\u00a0\u201cThis year, we have more of a complete team and it\u2019s a little bit more balanced in age. The kids seem to be less focused on hierarchy and more about development.\u201d\r\n\r\nSenior captain Zach Levitan also stressed that the team this year will be drastically different.\r\n\r\n\u201cOur whole defense has changed,\u201d Levitan said.\r\n\r\nJunior Matt Seligson echoed Levitan\u2019s sentiments, but emphasized that there are some up-and-coming players that will make an impact on the field.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe lost a lot of firepower this year,\u201d Seligson said. \u201c We\u2019ve got some promising talent in sophomores Hayden Libbey, who\u2019s been doing really well, and Christian Rider.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn addition to the younger players, this year\u2019s squad has several seasoned players that will be instrumental to Paly\u2019s success, according to Shelton.\r\n\r\n\u201c[Captains] Jon Rogers and Zach Levitan are just two of our outstanding players,\u201d Shelton said.\u00a0\u201c[Juniors] Matt Seligson, Cole Tierney, and Quintin Valenti are some other players to look out for.\u201d\r\n\r\nLast year the team finished 13-8 overall, 9-6 in league, and advanced to the semifinals of the SCVAL playoffs before being defeated by Menlo-Atherton High School. Now that fewer private schools, which have historically fielded strong lacrosse programs, are competing\u00a0with Paly in the De Anza league, Shelton believes that the team has a shot at winning the league title.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are looking to win league this year, and I think that\u2019s a reality,\u201d Shelton said. \u201cAll the private schools are gone, so while we play those teams, they\u2019re not in our league. League is becoming a very strong option for us.\u201d\r\n\r\nDespite the loss of the seniors\u00a0and a smaller roster, the team seems optimistic about its chances for success this season.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything that really stands in our way [of winning league], except ourselves,\u201d Shelton said.","excerpt":"Despite losing 14 seniors from last year, the Palo Alto High School boys\u2019 lacrosse team (1-0, 0-0) entertains high hopes for the upcoming season.","date":"2015-03-03 21:23:01","author":"Amy Leung","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/IMG_0003.jpg","categories":["Sports"],"tags":{"8491":"archbishop mitty","8537":"Boys","19371":"DJ Shelton","8836":"Lacrosse","9884":"league","8953":"paly","40097":"sacred heart prep","18834":"scvals","12045":"season preview","9090":"seniors"}},{"id":100468,"title":"Liveblog: Girls&#8217; soccer CCS semifinals vs. Santa Teresa","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/03\/03\/liveblog-girls-soccer-ccs-semifinals-vs-santa-teresa\/","content":"The Palo Alto High School girls' soccer team (16-2-1, 9-2-1) will be playing against Santa Teresa High School (15-6, 10-4) in the semifinals of the Cental Coast Section playoffs at 4:30 p.m. tomorrow at Palo Alto High School.
