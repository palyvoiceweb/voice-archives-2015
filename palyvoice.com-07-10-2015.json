Certain positions may take more multiple students.\r\n\r\nStudents will collaborate with the guidance of mentors in the field and will work towards a set goal, such as decreasing plastic litter on school campuses.\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/youtu.be\/_wD9PgswUVA\r\n\r\n<em>Senior Nicole Chen advertises the Get Involved Internship Program.

Berkson added that\u00a0there are companies that have mailing lists of households of certain demographics, which is how the organizer was able to mail the flyers out.\r\n\r\n\u201cLegally, the Paly sign or logo isn\u2019t trademarked or anything,\u201d Berkson said. \u201cHe [the organizer] didn\u2019t do anything illegal.

We received some great verbal feedback and many people stayed afterwards to ask questions.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Yin, this was the first time IntoWealth has hosted a workshop at Paly, but the company generally conducts workshops all over the Bay Area, including the lecture hall at its main office, other high school campuses and test preparation centers.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, the Palo Alto Unified School District has recently implemented a policy which states PAUSD will no longer rent school campuses to for-profit organizations for college counseling and standardized testing preparation.\u00a0According to Berkson, the new policy came into effect before the controversy surrounding the flyer, but after\u00a0the organizer's contract was signed. PAUSD's decision was made independent of this incident. However, this coincidence prompted concern from some people, Berkson said.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe [the administration] received a phone call from a parent about the workshop saying, 'Hey I thought you didn\u2019t do this [host events by for-profit organizations on campus] anymore,'\u201d Berkson said. \u201cI had to explain to them that the organizer's contract was signed before this whole thing.\"","excerpt":"Following a college-help organization's distribution of a deceptive promotional flyer, which included the Palo Alto High School sign for a non-school-affiliated event, the administration is not taking any action.","date":"2015-10-06 20:23:23","author":"Jeanette Wong","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/final-featured-image.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"22666":"admin","9683":"college help","58202":"college workshop","58201":"deceitful","58200":"deceptive","58203":"financial aid","58198":"flyer","58199":"fraudulous flyer","9954":"jerry berkson","8944":"palo alto high school","9067":"scandal","9207":"victoria kim"}},{"id":108670,"title":"Alumnus composes music for fall production","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/10\/06\/alumnus-composes-music-for-fall-production\/","content":"Professional actor, composer and Palo Alto High School alumnus Jonathan Shue, Class of 2001, is collaborating with students to create\u00a0original music for the theater department's fall show, \"The Odyssey\".\r\n\r\nStudents are working with the framework of previous music composed for a production of the Odyssey at Monta Vista High School to create a contemporary musical accompaniment, according to Shue.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhen I compose music for plays like this, where we have actors who aren't necessarily trained musicians, it's important to me that the music comes from their heart and soul and that they have a hand in the creative process,\u201d Shue said.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_109398\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"468\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/12092197_914983975244358_742084578_n.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-109398\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/12092197_914983975244358_742084578_n.jpg\" alt=\"12092197_914983975244358_742084578_n\" width=\"468\" height=\"351\" \/><\/a> Actors rehearse for the Odyssey, Paly Theater's fall production, outside the Haymarket. \"The Odyssey\" will begin showing at the Haymarket Theatre August 25-27.

Not only is Star-Lack a devoted listener, he also a skilled guitar player and singer. Photo by Nika Woodfill.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nIn this week's edition of Tuesday Tunes, The Paly Voice sat down with accomplished guitarist and RAJ band member senior Russell Star-Lack to ask how music has impacted his life.\r\n\r\nAccording to Star-Lack, who primarily plays guitar and sings, music helps him relieve the stress that comes with being a student.\r\n\r\n\u201cI listen to it [music] constantly, I play it constantly, I write it constantly,\u201d Star-Lack said. \u201cIt is the best way for me to deal with stress. If I have an issue, I might write a song about it or find one I can relate to, and it will help me deal with stuff.\"\r\n\r\nStar-Lack grew up around music and fell in love with it at an early age.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dad played guitar, and I thought that was really cool,\u201d Star-Lack said. \u201cWhen I was six, I was in the car with my mom and [Eric Clapton's] 'Layla' came on the radio and I thought, \u2018Oh my God, this is awesome. I want to do that.\u2019 And that's \u00a0really what got me started playing music.\u201d\r\n\r\nStar-Lack loves to find his inspiration from classic blues and rock legends.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy favorites are Eric Clapton and all the great guitar guys \u2014 Hendrix, the Allman brothers and Jimmy Page with Led Zeppelin,\u201d Star-Lack said. \u201cFor blues, Muddy Waters, Robert Johnson, Howlin\u2019 Wolf, BB King, Albert King, Freddie King, Stevie Ray Vaughan and Gary Clark Jr. All these guys are great and not appreciated enough.\u201d\r\n\r\nStar-Lack in particular loves blues for the raw emotion in its lyricism.\r\n\r\n\u201cBlues is really where it's at for me,\u201d Star-Lack said. \u201cThere\u2019s just something about the emotion in blues. It's oftentimes not as technically as advanced, but there's just this raw feeling in the lyrics that really show what was going on in the singer's mind at the time.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn his free time, Star-Lack likes to perform with his band RAJ, which are the initials of the other band members, including seniors Arjun Vasudevan and Jeremy Samos.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t take a lot of risks in my life, and I think that performing is how I get that feeling,\" Star-Lack said. \"It\u2019s addictive. I feel like I can express myself a lot better when I\u2019m performing in front of my friends, people who know or don\u2019t know me, than if I\u2019m just talking. I\u2019m very introverted, and it\u2019s kind of fun to be the exact opposite, to play guitar behind your head and sing really loud and just be crazy and have fun.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Star-Lack, it\u2019s important for people to expand their horizons and discover the world that music has to offer.\r\n\r\n\u201cI encourage people to at least try, or listen to different kinds of music,\u201d Star-Lack said. \u201cI consider myself a listener of music even more than I am a player of it. So even just listening to stuff you don\u2019t normally listen to and challenging yourself can really help broaden perspectives and maybe even help learn more about the world.\u201d\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/embed.spotify.com\/?uri=spotify%3Auser%3A1216334347%3Aplaylist%3A7As6tRWJbyWOptsYhbTR6j\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>","excerpt":"In this week's edition of Tuesday Tunes, The Paly Voice sat down with accomplished guitarist and RAJ band member senior Russell Star-Lack to ask how music has impacted his life.\r\n","date":"2015-10-06 11:36:33","author":"Sherwin Amsbaugh","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/FullSizeRender-1.jpg","categories":["Entertainment","Spotlight","Tuesday Tunes"],"tags":{"58192":"Arjun Vasudevan","58195":"Blues","58197":"Guitar","58193":"Jeremy Samos","8906":"music","58194":"RAJ","58196":"Rock","58191":"Russell Star-Lack","42416":"Tuesday Tunes"}},{"id":108780,"title":"News in Review: August &#038; September 2015","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/10\/05\/news-in-review-august-september-2015\/","content":"<iframe src=\"\/\/cdn.knightlab.com\/libs\/timeline3\/latest\/embed\/index.html?source=1FNFcQEsWmEDaCZqBq3LeuBMS1Y52MrdCRSn3nAs8ZSM&amp;font=Bitter-Raleway&amp;lang=en&amp;initial_zoom=2&amp;height=730\" width=\"100%\" height=\"730\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>","excerpt":"A timeline of the most important news stories and events from the start of the school year.","date":"2015-10-05 16:04:24","author":"Emily Hwang","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/Screen-Shot-2015-10-01-at-7.35.33-PM.png","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"19460":"2015","47570":"august","10012":"emily hwang","40814":"jeanette wong","9765":"multimedia","8916":"news","58130":"news editor","58129":"news editors","38267":"news in review","8939":"palo alto","8944":"palo alto high school","8953":"paly","8977":"PAUSD","8985":"photo","29303":"september","29797":"timeline","11060":"tutorial","29808":"twitter","9208":"video"}},{"id":109186,"title":"Football takes down Saratoga in league opener","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/10\/04\/football-takes-down-saratoga-in-league-opener\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_109232\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"650\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/PaulJIII.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-109232\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/PaulJIII.jpg\" alt=\"PaulJIII\" width=\"650\" height=\"488\" \/><\/a> Sophomore running back Paul Jackson III runs the ball down the field late in the fourth quarter.

They came together when it mattered.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Vikings were tied at the end of regulation play, with a notable comeback from Paly in the last minute and a half of the 4th quarter. Junior center Peter Snodgrass intercepted a pass from Saratoga junior quarterback Will Liddle and set up a drive that ended on the\u00a01-yard line after a last second pass to Givens was just short of the touchdown.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt [the interception] definitely helped us turn the momentum of the game,\u201d Snodgrass said. \u201cIt was a team effort, though. We had [junior center] Alec Cohen-Schisler fill in for me [while out with a calf cramp], and he played awesome in that drive. He totally led our offensive line.\u201d\r\n\r\nRunning a balanced offense helped the Vikings\u00a0open up the field and find success, according to senior wide receiver Riley Schoeben.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe finally got to run the ball,\u201d Schoeben said. \u201cThat really opens up the pass game for Eli [Givens] and I, and [senior] Justin [Hull] got us the ball.\u201d\r\n\r\nSaratoga head coach Tim Lugo accepted the loss graciously, but saw the game as something to build off of for the future.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was a good high school football game by two pretty good football teams and, you know, hats off to Palo Alto,\u201d Lugo said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be okay, we just have some things to fix.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Paly senior captain and running back Takeru Nishi, focusing on cleaning up the defense will be a main goal for the Vikings in upcoming weeks, but remains confident in the team\u2019s abilities.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe need to work on not letting big plays past us, which is what happened tonight,\u201d Nishi said. \u201cIf we can work on our defense and work on cleaning that up, I think we have a good chance of beating anyone.\u201d\r\n\r\nPaly is set to take on the Milpitas Trojans (3-2, 1-0) at 7 p.m. on Friday, Oct. 9, for their first De Anza league away game.","excerpt":"Palo Alto High School football (2-3, 1-0) triumphed over the Saratoga Falcons (1-3, 0-1) in the first De Anza league game of the season on Friday at home in double overtime by a final score of 42-35.","date":"2015-10-04 20:35:17","author":"Emma van der Veen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/PaulJIII.jpg","categories":["Football","Sports","Sports Recap","Spotlight"],"tags":{"19460":"2015","9656":"eli givens","8692":"falcons","8714":"football","25417":"halas","58189":"lugo","58188":"overtime","8944":"palo alto high school","8953":"paly","49545":"peter snodgrass","56300":"riley schoeben","10752":"saratoga high school","58030":"takeru nishi","9210":"vikings"}},{"id":109166,"title":"&#8220;Shrek the Musical Jr.&#8221; is monstrous fun","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/10\/03\/shrek-the-musical-jr-is-monstrous-fun\/","content":"\"Shrek\" is a title that many young people would recognize \u2014 who isn\u2019t familiar with that misunderstood, lovable green ogre? After all, it is a 2001 DreamWorks film that captured the hearts of young and old alike and spawned three successful sequels. The Palo Alto High School stage production \"Shrek the Musical Jr.,\" aimed toward children, maintains the charm of familiar characters from <em>Shrek<\/em>\u00a0with the addition of an entertaining musical element.\r\n\r\nDirected by Paly parent Tony Kienitz, the musical follows a truncated but similar storyline to the movie: Shrek, an ogre, reluctantly embarks on a journey with an enthusiastic Donkey to save Princess Fiona so she can marry Lord Farquaad. After Shrek completes this task, he can have his swamp back.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_109216\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"435\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/45612_full.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-109216\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/45612_full.jpg\" alt=\"shrek\" width=\"435\" height=\"316\" \/><\/a> Junior Declan Flanders, freshman Gil Weissman, junior Alia Cuadros-Contreras and freshman Robert Vetter star as Shrek, Donkey, Princess Fiona and Lord Farquaad in \"Shrek the Musical Jr.,\" a show tailored to kids. The production features singing, dancing and silly jokes. Photo by Kristina Vetter.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe show is full of musical numbers, dancing and eclectic characters. The jokes in the musical are obviously directed at a kid's sense of humor\u2014there is a\u00a0variety of the classic name-calling, fart jokes and other general goofy and hilarious dialogue.\r\n\r\nEach cast member of the musical does a wonderful job at appealing to a younger audience. Freshman Gil Weissman as Donkey strikes the ideal balance between annoying and humorous. Lord Farquaad, played by freshman Robert Vetter, is one of the most well-casted characters of the production and has the most creative costume in the show. <em>Shrek<\/em> (junior Declan Flanders) is as grumpy as ever and Princess Fiona (junior Alia Cuadros-Contreras) is a more complex character than one would initially expect from a narcissistic princess.\r\n\r\nThe musical aspect of the production is satisfying.\u00a0Two standout songs from the production are \"Story of My Life\" and \"Finale,\" because they both feature the cast's eclectic mix of characters. The set and costumes both work well within the show. Many characters wear fake stomachs and noses, and Shrek's costume is extremely reminiscent of the film version. Face paint is used to color the faces of several fairytale characters.\r\n\r\nDuring a showing on Thursday with an elementary school audience, everyone seemed to be laughing and having a good time though the young audience\u2019s attention ebbed and flowed. In the middle of the play, it was easy to tell that the kids were getting restless. At the conclusion of the show, however, the children erupted in roaring applause, with some even offering a standing ovation.\r\n\r\nSome technical difficulties during the show inhibit enjoyment. The microphones didn\u2019t work throughout almost the whole show, making the singing and funny lyrics hard to hear.\r\n\r\n\"Shrek the Musical Jr.\"\u00a0is a show that delivers lighthearted entertainment that is perfect for children but also appropriate for those who have already graduated elementary school. The characters will take you back to memories from the original \"Shrek\"<em>\u00a0<\/em>movie and the\u00a0tunes will be stuck in your head for hours.\r\n\r\nThe show lasts a little over one hour and 10 minutes. Shrek the Musical, Jr. premiered on Oct. 2, and there will be two showings on Sunday, Oct. 4 at 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. Tickets are available at the door and <a href=\"https:\/\/search.seatyourself.biz\/webstore\/webstore.html?event=.&amp;domain=palytheatre\" target=\"_blank\">online<\/a>\u00a0and cost $5 for students and children and $10 for adults.","excerpt":"The fall production of Shrek the Musical Jr. is a show that maintains the charm of familiar characters from Shrek but also adds an entertaining musical element.","date":"2015-10-03 10:03:36","author":"Emily Hwang","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/45612_full.jpg","categories":["Entertainment","Spotlight"],"tags":{"58187":"dancing","19628":"musical","8953":"paly","40135":"production","29648":"show","58186":"shrek","38610":"singing","9159":"theater","9160":"theatre","42304":"tickets"}},{"id":109132,"title":"Volleyball team defeats Homestead Mustangs","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/10\/02\/volleyball-team-defeats-homestead-mustangs\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_109134\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/IMG_3515.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-109134\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/IMG_3515.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_3515\" width=\"600\" height=\"407\" \/><\/a> Sophomore outside hitter Chelsea Fan serves the ball during Palo Alto High School's game Thursday against the Homestead Mustangs.

Students gather in the bleachers and shout pre-arranged cheers that supported class unity\u00a0and expressed school spirit. \u00a0Photo by Molly Fogarty and Cathy Rong.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAs September draws to a close,\u00a0many Palo Alto High School students look forward to\u00a0one exciting event amid all their tests, projects and deadlines \u2014 Spirit Week.\r\n\r\nWith only three weeks until one of the liveliest\u00a0weeks of the school year, it's time to start getting pumped. Although it might be a little too early to dig those costumes out, there are\u00a0a number of ways to\u00a0start getting involved in your grade\u2019s preparation. You could provide your artistic ability in the float or t-shirt designing, contribute your dancing skills\u00a0(or lack thereof) to\u00a0your grade\u2019s spirit dance\u00a0or write a cheer for the lunchtime rallies.\r\n\r\nFor the freshmen or\u00a0new kids out there, one of the most exciting aspects of Spirit Week is\u00a0the daily cheers. During every lunchtime of Spirit Week, each grade presents short cheers corresponding with the daily dress-up theme, the activity or the class as a whole. These cheers are normally submitted in the grade\u2019s Spirit Week Facebook\u00a0group and picked by Associated Student Body\u00a0leaders\u00a0based on popular choice and effectiveness.\r\n\r\nWant to contribute a cheer to your grade but don\u2019t know how to get started? We\u2019ve compiled a list of the top six\u00a0tips for writing a killer cheer.\r\n\r\n<b>Rhyming cheers work the best:<\/b>\r\n\r\n\u201cI think what has typically worked well in the past are cheers that are easy to say as a big group and cheers that rhyme well,\u201d senior ASB Secretary Joseph Kao said. \u201cIt sounds more fluent and united that way.\u201d\r\n\r\nRhyming is one of the most important parts in creating a cheer. The end of each line should rhyme with the next\u00a0down to the exact\u00a0syllable to create a flowing, powerful cheer. When a cheer does not rhyme exactly, the class is usually unable\u00a0to chant it correctly and ends up stumbling over the words. To get the most points for the cheers, you need to perfect its\u00a0delivery. One of the best\u00a0feelings during Spirit Week is when your class is able to perfectly deliver a cheer without any prior experience.\r\n\r\n<b>Seven syllables, seven syllables:<\/b>\r\n\r\nAccording to junior class President Noa Ben-Efraim and junior ASB Vice President Anmol Nagar, the best structural choice for a smooth-flowing,\u00a0easy Spirit Week cheer is a two-lined cheer with seven syllables in each. Too many syllables can sound clunky and is often difficult for a grade to repeat back with ease. So when coming up with those cheers, clap out those seven syllables and if necessary, bust out a thesaurus to help find a word that could fit the requirement.\r\n\r\nHere's a few cheers used in the past that follow the seven syllable rule:\r\n\r\nThe Class of 2017 produced a cheer with seven syllables in each line for the gym rally's three-point basketball competition:\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Upperclassmen might have keys, \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0but at least we sink our three's<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Class of 2015 used the seven syllable rule in creating a cheer regarding their class theme (The Great Gatsby):<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0NYC around the bend, \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Gatsby's party never ends<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>Be appropriate:<\/b><\/p>\r\nMaking cheers that are appropriate is key. Paly's Spirit Week\u00a0is a school event, so don't use any words or phrases that you wouldn't normally say in class. Stick only to cheers that judges will approve because points are deducted for inappropriate cheers. Boos and profanity decrease scores (as well as\u00a0throwing objects or disrupting competitions in any way). In the end, Spirit Week\u00a0is meant to be a fun and stress-free event, so make sure to be appropriate and create a safe space for all fellow Paly\u00a0students who simply want to show off their school spirit.\r\n\r\n\"I would make sure the cheers are appropriate because different judges judge things differently,\" Ben-Efraim said.\r\n\r\n<b>Focus on supporting your grade, not attacking others:<\/b>\r\n\r\nTry to avoid too many of those zinger cheers that put down\u00a0other grades. Although they might be fun to come up with, try to keep it positive. According to Ben-Efraim, this will boost scoring for your grade and means you can reuse your cheers.\r\n\r\n\u201cI suggest that the grade focus more on their individual grades instead of being sassy and cheeky towards other grades,\u201d Ben-Efraim said. \u201cYou'll get more points and you can have cooler cheers that can last the entire week.\u201d\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the judges will take off points for sportsmanship if any grade gets too nasty towards another. Although this hasn\u2019t happened in a few years, the judges will take off 50 points from a grade\u2019s total for \u201cany negative or inappropriate cheers, if anyone uses noise makers other than their own clapping and cheering, or if anyone is violent towards another student,\" according to <a href=\"https:\/\/sites.google.com\/site\/pahsasb\/sw2014\">ASB's website.<\/a>\r\n\r\nFifty\u00a0points can completely\u00a0offset a victory in a lunchtime activity or bring a cheer's first place score down to third place.\r\n\r\n<b>Show your school spirit:<\/b>\r\n\r\nSpirit Week's\u00a0main purpose is to unify Paly's student body. Even though each class joins in a strong competition against each other, the judges still look for students who work together, no matter the\u00a0grade. Classes that create cheers to show support for all Paly students show off their school spirit stronger than others. Judges love Paly-unity\u00a0cheers and will think highly of each class that cares about the school as a whole.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, teaming up with other classes\u00a0to show off your school spirit allows the cheers to be louder and therefore more powerful. The judges love when they see two grades working together for cheers. So get together with another class ahead of time and prepare a few cheers that you can both do together at one of the lunch or after-school rallies.\r\n\r\n<b>Be loud and have fun:<\/b>\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, no matter how clever or inclusive your cheer is, it won\u2019t make a difference if no one can hear it. According to junior class Vice President Natalie Maloney, being loud is the most important part of a successful cheer.\r\n\r\n\u201cBeing loud is mostly what we are judged on,\u201d Maloney said. \u201cSo that will earn the most points.\u201d\r\n\r\nMake sure as many members of your grade come to the daily lunch rallies, and make sure you participate as much as possible.
