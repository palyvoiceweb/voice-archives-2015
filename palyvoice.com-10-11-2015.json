Is it the powerful rule of the Greek gods or the tales of the humans that worship them? Do you remember grand stories of heroism about slaying horrendous monsters? In \u201cThe Odyssey,\u201d the Palo Alto High School Theater Department aims to bring the world of ancient Greece back to life and showcases the long journey of Odysseus on his return home from the Trojan War. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of the play, written by playwright Mary Zimmerman, chronicles the enormous amount of obstacles Odysseus (senior Ophir Sneh) faces during his journey, including an angry cyclops, enchanting sirens, vindictive gods and rowdy lords. However, the difficulties endure after his return, as Odysseus must fight to restore the life he had before the war. Along the way, the goddess Athena (senior Sophie Swezey), Odysseus' son, Telemachus (junior Jackson Kienitz) and other characters help Odysseus. His grieving wife Penelope (senior Molly Kraus) fights off suitors who wish to marry her since her husband Odysseus is presumed dead. Though it is usually clear what is going on, the short modern-day element at the beginning of the play is slightly confusing and seems irrelevant to the rest of the plot.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The cast members do a great job of capturing the essence of their characters. The dialogue is understandable, and the story is portrayed nicely whether it is a lighthearted, fun moment or a serious scene. Odysseus, with his sincerity and determination, is convincing in his image of a hero, and is nicely balanced by the loud and foolish actions of rowdy nobles (senior Matthew O\u2019Reilly, junior Jason Pollak and senior Daniel Cottrell). A\u00a0silent muse shows\u00a0the audience, through body movements, the transferring of ideas from gods to mortals in a fluid, creative manner.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The show features one main set with a backdrop of waves, clouds and rocks. Throughout the play, the location and time period is projected onto the stage to help clarify the plot. Greek columns are cleverly lifted on and off stage depending on the scene, and a platform in the back showcases the presence of the Olympic gods. The huge puppet used to create the character of the cyclops is a particularly impressive prop, and adds a dramatic feel to an action-packed scene. The presence of a boat is smartly substituted by artfully arranged chairs, convincing pole movements to represent rowing and characters that sway to the drift of the faux ocean. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The characters\u2019 costumes showcased great attention to detail, with a modern twist on some of the garments and accessories such as necklaces and headpieces. Although the torn tunics, leggings and pants of some of the characters were simple, they seemed authentic to their station. The goddesses had interesting, flowing dress variations and the make-up on the nymph Calypso (junior Nadia Leinhos) is particularly beautiful. In instances when characters were \u201cdisguised,\u201d clever costume switches that do not disguise the actual identity of the character are utilized.<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_111537\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/unnamed.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-111537\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/unnamed.jpg\" alt=\"Calypso (junior Nadia Leinhos) holds Odysseus captive on her island, rendering him unable to return home to Ithaca.

Photo courtesy of Yi Ge.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the standout features of the production is the musical element. Recorded music, <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/10\/06\/alumnus-composes-music-for-fall-production\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">composed by alumnus Jonathan Shue<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as well as live music provided by student musicians junior Edward Park and junior Laura Sieh, accompanies the actors during almost every scene with an assortment of instruments such as bajo sexto, drums and wind chimes. The calm and melodic music makes watching it much more entertaining and helps to fully immerse the audience into ancient Greece. Interesting and artistic use of scarves and chairs as props during dance sequences made scene changes flow smoothly and helped set the tone for the next scene. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An epic saga that includes elements of adventure, romance and tragedy, \u201cThe Odyssey\u201d is a production that does justice to Homer\u2019s classic poem. It will please the eyes and ears of theater-goers of almost any age, though small children might get restless with\u00a0the two hours and 30 minutes running length. Although the first act seems to move a little slowly, the second act picks up momentum and carries it to the end, providing for a satisfying conclusion.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe Odyssey\u201d has four more showings on Nov. 7, Nov. 8, Nov. 12 and Nov. 13.

Allow your eyes to close.\" This is how Christopher Farina's Advanced Placement psychology students begin their class each day.\r\n\r\nThe students perform mindful meditation, a popular form of relaxation in which participants focus on their thoughts, feelings, sounds or breath by sitting in silence with their eyes closed.\u00a0This method does not require any spiritual belief, but rather, it gives individuals an opportunity to shut out unnecessary thoughts to facilitate a deeper connection with themselves.\u00a0Meditational practice, which stems from an ancient Buddhist relaxation practice, has become increasingly popular\u00a0in Western culture in recent years, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/blog\/meditation-modern-life\/201307\/overview-meditation-its-origins-and-traditions\" target=\"_blank\">Psychology Today<\/a>.\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/life.gaiam.com\/article\/meditation-101-techniques-benefits-beginner-s-how\" target=\"_blank\">Studies<\/a> show that a\u00a0few minutes of this mindful meditation\u00a0each\u00a0day can lead to\u00a0emotional benefits that mirror the benefits of physical activity.\r\n\r\nPalo Alto High School should systematically implement meditation into the beginning of certain\u00a0class periods per week to reduce stress, foster\u00a0a healthy class\u00a0environment and encourage high levels of focus.\r\n\r\nOn a typical school day, most teachers are unable to give their students time to exercise or participate in stress-relieving\u00a0activities. With that, students are expected to sit for six hours each day, with an occasional break, while simultaneously maintaining a healthy well being.\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This causes stress that often weighs down students, and it is essential to\u00a0find an effective\u00a0method to alleviate\u00a0it. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To their credit, Paly administrators have focused on finding\u00a0ways to reduce\u00a0Paly's\u00a0high-stress culture in the past years.\u00a0One of their solutions\u00a0included\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/04\/29\/paly-teachers-incorporate-meditation-into-the-classroom\/\" target=\"_blank\">introducing meditation<\/a>\u00a0into classrooms. By the end of the year, however, most teachers did not continue the practice, aside from a select few.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Josh Bloom, astronomy teacher and Teacher on Special Assignment for social and emotional learning, is one of the few faculty members who introduces students to meditational practices\u00a0each year. According to Bloom, he began the\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mindful practice five years ago to sort out the stress in his own life. After\u00a0Bloom found the results to be\u00a0beneficial,\u00a0he decided to share the practice\u00a0with his students.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pressure on kids in this community around this idea of success, what success means, and what's required for success,\u201d\u00a0Bloom said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Introducing just five minutes of meditation at the beginning of each class\u00a0at Paly could be the beginning of a solution to this problem.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meditation has been shown to reduce\u00a0feelings of anxiety, increase calmness and enable people to enjoy their lives to a fuller and happier extent.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For students, meditation is a chance to control\u00a0one's own\u00a0mind\u00a0and live in the present moment, providing an opportunity to pause during\u00a0a hectic\u00a0day, according to the website, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tipsonlifeandlove.com\/self-help\/meditating-your-way-to-greater-happiness-and-health-in-20-minutes-a-day\" target=\"_blank\">Love &amp;\u00a0Life<\/a>.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cThe mindfulness of this experience is creating space for you to focus on what's going on inside of you,\u201d Bloom says. \u201cTo allow yourself to step back and become aware of your thoughts, and how you're thinking.\u201d\r\n\r\nMeditation is also a way to focus attention and eliminate the stream of thoughts crowding your mind. Students who meditate during class time will find themselves retaining information better after\u00a0refueling. They will be able to work harder with more energy, and therefore succeed more in their classes.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The practice of meditation also\u00a0benefits students physically.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meditation enables an inner quiet and peace in people, which has been scientifically proven to slow the heart rate, lower blood pressure and decrease the production of stress hormones. Just five minutes a day of this practice grows the areas of the brain associated with memory, empathy and sense of self, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.medicaldaily.com\/mental-health-benefits-meditation-itll-alter-your-brains-grey-matter-and-improve-319298\" target=\"_blank\">Medical Daily<\/a>,\u00a0a website dedicated to sharing studies on\u00a0mental health.<\/span>\r\n\r\nStudents could begin to earn these physical and emotional benefits if teachers of one required course introduce meditation into their classes. Therefore, students would be given a chance to experience the practice two or three times per week, which is enough time to receive healthy benefits\u00a0through just a brief five minutes a day.\r\n\r\nThis would require commitment from the\u00a0department, and a<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lthough some might argue\u00a0that these\u00a0practices would waste valuable class time, one should keep in mind that it takes less than five minutes at the beginning of a class period, providing benefits that outweigh the small amount of time used for meditation.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">English teacher George Vuong, who has introduced\u00a0meditation to students after learning about the method at the end of last\u00a0year, advocates for other teachers to introduce it as well.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThis is a good beginning of a class period to kind of help things get settled down and make a more calm environment,\u201d Vuong said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meditation\u00a0creates many more focused, relaxed and de-stressed students, allowing students to\u00a0put in more\u00a0effort, interest and their attention into the period's\u00a0classwork.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\"[Through meditation] y<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ou begin to discover the aspects of ourselves that are common to all human beings,\" said Bloom. \"The more you come to know and understand that part of our human being, the more we begin to understand that part being in all of us.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\nWho knew that a simple five minute task every few\u00a0days could so significantly impact our lives?","excerpt":"Staff writer Morgan Keller shares her opinion on implementing meditational practices into the beginning of class periods.","date":"2015-11-07 09:53:30","author":"Morgan Keller","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/abcd1.jpg","categories":["Opinion","Spotlight"],"tags":["meditation","opinion","paly"]},{"id":111557,"title":"Second quarter progress reports are released on Friday, Nov. 13","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/11\/06\/second-quarter-progress-reports-are-released-on-friday-nov-13\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2015-11-06 23:13:07","author":"Josh Yuen","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]},{"id":111555,"title":"Seniors: CSU\/UC Application help on Tuesday, Nov. 10 during tutorial","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/11\/06\/seniors-csuuc-application-help-on-tuesday-nov-10-during-tutorial\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2015-11-06 23:08:55","author":"Josh Yuen","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]},{"id":111318,"title":"APPetite: Spindle, the selfish app","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/11\/05\/appetite-spindle-the-selfish-app\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_111511\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"532\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/Spindle.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-111511\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/Spindle.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"532\" height=\"341\" \/><\/a> Last week, Stanford alumni and founders of social app Spindle, Amanda Lin and Alex Walker, visited The Paly Voice to talk about Spindle and its goal of being a \u201cselfish app.\u201d Photo by Cooper Lou.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nDo you want to journal your life? Are you tired of traditional social media sites? If so, Stanford alumni and founders of the social app Spindle, Alex Walker and Amanda Lin, may have a solution for you. The two\u00a0visited The Paly Voice last week\u00a0to talk about <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/spindle-tell-it-like-it-is\/id970237649?mt=8\">Spindle<\/a> and its goal of\u00a0being a \u201cselfish app.\"\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although at first glance, Spindle may seem to resemble\u00a0other social apps\u00a0like\u00a0Instagram and Twitter, its overarching goals are\u00a0different.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cA lot of current social media revolve around people creating an image of themselves,\u201d Lin said. \u201cWe wanted people to have a space to allow them to be\u00a0<\/span>themselves and document their lives. [Spindle\u2019s like a personal] journal, that also allows people to share certain entries.\u201d\r\n\r\nThrough their application, Walker and Lin seek to emulate real life conversations and discussions.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn life, people have different friend groups,\" Lin said. \u201cSomething you share with one group might not be what you want to share with another. With Spindle, you get to choose what to share with each group. There\u2019s no friending on Spindle and the recipient of every entry, [if you choose to share it,] is dependent on you.\u201d\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Walker and Lin founded Spindle after meeting\u00a0at Stanford University. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe went to Stanford together and graduated in 2013,\u201d Walker said. \u201cWe became really good friends in freshmen year and started Spindle when we graduated. Stanford taught us that it was okay to go for something since the people around you are constantly taking these risks. You\u2019re taught that anything is possible. Together, we\u2019ve been working on this for a little over\u00a0nine months.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Lin, she and Walker used their experience with product design, computer science, symbolic systems and design to build their app from scratch.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_110995\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"603\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/screen-shot-2015-09-03-at-11-30-27-pm.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-110995\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/screen-shot-2015-09-03-at-11-30-27-pm.png\" alt=\"screen-shot-2015-09-03-at-11-30-27-pm\" width=\"603\" height=\"390\" \/><\/a> Spindle co-founder Amanda Lin's joy at climbing to the top of Half Dome turned into fear when she thought she would fall off when jumping for a photo.

Photo courtesy of Amanda Lin.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA typical Spindle can be short, but users can group them together to create a story.\u00a0The application\u00a0acts as a journal for important life moments.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cMy proudest Spindle is [my story] of when I ran a half marathon,\u201d Lin said. \u201cI\u2019m not a runner and I\u00a0hate running, but I challenged myself. I tracked my practice runs, the events leading up to the weekend and the race itself.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Walker, Spindle also allows you to see the days\u00a0during which you saved the most highlights.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\"Spindle only saves the [what you deem as] highlights,\" Lin said. \"With texts [or social media], there\u2019s a whole lot of other stuff. Spindle saves the best of the best, happiest and saddest stories.\u201d\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The inspiration for Spindle came from Walker and Lin\u2019s desire to remember the little moments in life. <\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are both storytellers,\u201d Walker said. \u201cOften times, the stories you want to share aren't big events.

Illustration by Portia Barrientos.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nIn an effort to get more high schoolers to participate in politics, a civic education project is offering an essay and a cartoon contest from which students can win prizes. \r\n\r\nLegischool, a civic education project that is working with California State University, Sacramento on this project, will award a round trip to Sacramento to meet and talk with state legislators to the winner of the essay contest and prize money to the winner of the cartoon contest.  According to LegiSchool Project Director Terre Thorne, the contests' goal is to get more teens involved with government policies.\r\n\r\n\"LegiSchool\u2019s mission is to engage high school students in matters of public policy and state government,\" Thorne said. \"One of the ways we hope to achieve that goal is through our contests, which we created to get students thinking critically about important issues. Our hope is that participation in our contests will make government relevant to young people and inspire an interest in civic life.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to the LegiSchool Project website, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.csus.edu\/calst\/LegiSchool_contests\/2015EssayFlyer.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">essay contest<\/a> requires students to write about their opinions on issues regarding low voter turnout among youth. The competition is available to all juniors and seniors in California.\r\n\r\nThe top 10 students will win a trip to Sacramento and get the chance to meet state legislators and share their ideas with them. \r\n\r\nAccording to Thorne, participants in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.csus.edu\/calst\/LegiSchool_contests\/2015_Art_Contest.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">cartoon contest<\/a> must write an original political cartoon about a current political issue. All high schoolers can participate and students can only write one cartoon. The student who draws the most creative cartoon will win $150 and the next four runner-ups will win $100 each. The top five cartoons will also be showcased on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kqed.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">KQED.org<\/a>.\r\n\r\nThe deadline for the essay competition is Nov. 18 and the deadline for the cartoon contest is Dec. 4.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"In an effort to get more high schoolers to participate in politics,  a civic education project is offering an essay and a cartoon contest from which students can win prizes.
