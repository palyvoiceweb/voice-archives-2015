At Palo Alto High School, however, 40 students were given the opportunity\u00a0to work with alumnus James Franco to become acquainted with his knowledge of film. The first of eight James Franco-led film workshops took place from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. today in the Media Arts Center.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/09\/07\/james-franco-to-teach-film-course-in-mac\/\" target=\"_blank\">After considering approximately 500 applicants<\/a>, the leaders of the workshop selected students from Palo Alto High School, Gunn High School, Menlo School and Los Altos High School on Sept. 12, a day prior to the first workshop.\r\n\r\nStudents were first introduced to their assignment for the year: to film certain scenes in groups from the screenplay \u201cMetamorphosis: Junior Year\u201d by Amber Cony, based on the <a href=\"https:\/\/books.google.com\/books\/about\/Metamorphosis.html?id=p0Y9oImKJQsC&amp;hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">novel and stage play<\/a>\u00a0by James Franco's mother, Betsy Franco. At the end of the year, the groups will unify each of their respective scenes into one film, to eventually be submitted to the <a href=\"http:\/\/cinequest.org\/film-festival\" target=\"_blank\">Cinequest Film Festival<\/a> in San Jose.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay follows the life of a teenager, Ovid, and his everyday interactions with his friends, whether it be the poet, filmmaker or cyber-couple. Carrying his own painful secret, Ovid transcribes his confessions into his notebook, while maintaining a strong passion for art and modern-day Roman mythology references.\r\n\r\nAfter introductions, participants were assigned mock roles for a live reading of the script, which soon generated discussion of what students wanted to change, add or manipulate to the screenplay.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe got to listen to all the different voices,\u201d Menlo sophomore Ari Troper said.\r\n\r\nStudents were then split into permanent eight groups of five, with each group in charge of filming particular characters and scenes. Among each of the five participants, students assigned themselves a specific job of either director, producer, cinematographer, writer or editor.\r\n\r\nJames Franco ended the workshop with a live commentary of \u201cThe Myth of an American Teenager,\u201d a coming-of-age movie with a similar theme to \u201cMetamorphosis: Junior Year.\u201d\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_107862\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"445\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/0-4.jpeg\"><img class=\"wp-image-107862\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/0-4.jpeg\" alt=\"0-4\" width=\"445\" height=\"298\" \/><\/a> Esther Wojcicki (right) greets James Franco (left) in front of the Media Arts Center as students arrive in the morning.

Learning is what he is all about. I think this is his way of giving back.\u201d","excerpt":"The first of eight James Franco-led film workshops took place from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. in the Media Arts Center today.","date":"2015-09-13 20:14:47","author":"Morgan Keller","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/0-5.jpeg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"29838":"alumnus","53632":"Betsy","53630":"conquest","53629":"eight","53636":"esther","8703":"festival","8706":"film","29992":"franco","8751":"gunn","10749":"high school","29991":"james","8801":"james franco","53634":"junior year","9849":"los altos","17729":"Menlo","53635":"metamorphosis","53638":"myth of american teenager","53637":"myth of american teenagr","8939":"palo alto","8944":"palo alto high school","8953":"paly","10117":"san jose","53633":"screenplay","53631":"Tom","12702":"wojcicki","29088":"workshop"}},{"id":107844,"title":"Advisory this week is for all juniors and select freshmen (L-Z)","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/09\/13\/advisory-this-week-is-for-all-juniors-and-select-freshmen-l-z\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2015-09-13 12:59:45","author":"Josh Yuen","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]},{"id":107559,"title":"Verbatim: Who will win this year&#8217;s Super Bowl?","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/09\/11\/verbatim-who-will-win-this-years-super-bowl\/","content":"With the National Football League's annual Super Bowl coming to Santa Clara this February, The Paly Voice asked students which teams they believed would play in the biggest football game of the year.\r\n\r\nHover over the white dots to see what they have to say.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alwaysThinglink\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\" src=\"\/\/cdn.thinglink.me\/api\/image\/698693490963382274\/1024\/10\/scaletowidth#tl-698693490963382274;1043138249'\" alt=\"\" \/><script src=\"\/\/cdn.thinglink.me\/jse\/embed.js\" async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>","excerpt":"With the National Football League's annual Super Bowl coming to San Francisco this February, The Paly Voice asked students which teams they believed would play in the biggest football game of the year.","date":"2015-09-11 19:38:47","author":"Sherwin Amsbaugh","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/Voice-SuperBowl1.png","categories":["Sports","Verbatims"],"tags":{"53301":"alec olmstead","53305":"ankita amberkar","37718":"eli friedlander","8714":"football","53303":"george welch","53302":"john liu","53299":"julia taylor","53308":"nfl","53306":"nura mstaghimi","10667":"santa clara","53298":"super bowl","53300":"taylor","53307":"timothy liu","53304":"will sallomi"}},{"id":107536,"title":"Liveblog: Football vs. San Benito","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/09\/11\/liveblog-football-vs-san-benito\/","content":"Check back here for live updates beginning at 7:15 p.m. as the Palo Alto High School football team (1-0, 0-0) hosts the San Benito Haybalers (1-0, 0-0) for its second game of the season.
