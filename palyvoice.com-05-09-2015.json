[{"id":106870,"title":"Ban on junior Spirit Week theme idea causes uproar","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/09\/04\/ban-on-junior-spirit-week-theme-idea-causes-uproar\/","content":"A few Palo Alto High School juniors prompted a response from Paly administration after harshly criticizing a ruling to ban a Spirit Week theme idea deemed culturally insensitive.\n\nIn the Class of 2017 Spirit Week theme meeting on Sept. 1, students selected the theme \"Gold Chains\" as one of the top options. The theme would consist of students dressing to mimic hip-hop culture. Student Activities Director Matthew Hall went to administration to approve the theme, but it was quickly ruled out.\n\nIn the wake of the decision, several juniors posted on Facebook to express their opinions on the matter. According to junior Adrian Smith, he posted a photo of a hand controlling a puppet in the \u201cPaly Class of 2017\u201d Facebook group because the decision brought up issues of student voice.\n\n\u201cI felt like the student body [Associated Student Body] wasn\u2019t a \u2018student-based\u2019 group,\u201d Smith said. \u201cMy original goal of posting that picture was to speak for us students and to slightly send a message to the staff.\u201d\n\nPrincipal Kim Diorio directed an email yesterday towards the whole Class of 2017 but specifically responded to the upset students who posted on Facebook to express their opinions, calling some messages \u201churtful, accusatory and cruel.\u201d Diorio explains the rationale and process for banning the theme in her email.\n\n\u201cFirst, instead of being upset with your peers or teachers, please know the administrative team at Paly unanimously ruled against the 'Gold chains\/thug life' theme based on concerns of cultural appropriation, offending others and\/or perpetuating stereotypes,\u201d Diorio said in the email. \u201cWe recognize, and this Facebook page confirms to some degree, a greater need for sensitivity training and developing empathy and compassion towards one another at Paly.\u201d\n\nAt first, junior Emily Read said she did not recognize the reasoning for banning the theme. According to Read, other class members were also bothered when the decision first went public. At the time it was not clear to everyone as to who had made the decision, so people incorrectly held ASB accountable for the ban. Junior Ibby Day also believes students directed their frustrations at the wrong people.\n\n\u201cI think a lot of the people who were angry at the banned theme don't really understand what ASB's part in this whole thing is,\u201d Day said. \u201cI think many people use ASB as a direct way to start a fight because it is mostly student-run, and they don't want to bring up the issue to the Paly admin adults.\u201d\n\nDay says she wrote a Facebook post in the class group to defend the members of ASB, who were the intended recipients of some unkind messages written by juniors.\n\n<span style=\"color: #141823;\">\"I want to defend ASB again because all they are doing is making sure that Paly doesn't get sued for a week that honestly has no apparent value besides fun and cooperation amongst peers,\" Day said in the post.<\/span>\n\nAccording to Day, she was disturbed by the disrespect being aimed toward ASB.\n\n\u201cPeople were making rash accusations towards people who were only trying to keep Spirit Week fun and inclusive,\" Day said.\n\nAccording to Read, she realized the cause of the ban after explanations by Diorio and Hall,&nbsp;though she is still disappointed with the final outcome.\n\n\u201cI'm still upset that it [the theme] was banned, but I understand why and I agree with it not being used,\u201d Read said.\n\nDay appreciates Diorio\u2019s message to her class as well.\n\n\u201cI feel her response was completely appropriate to the situation,\u201d Day said. \u201cShe handled it professionally and [was] open-minded, and I'm glad she took action because those who targeted ASB need to understand that if they have a serious concern with why spirit week themes are banned, they have the opportunity to work it out with an admin.\u201d","excerpt":"A few Palo Alto High School juniors prompted a response from administration after harshly criticizing a ruling to ban a Spirit Week theme idea deemed culturally insensitive.","date":"2015-09-04 18:37:44","author":"Emily Hwang","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/soph1.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":{"8458":"administration","50762":"ban","8644":"diorio","14282":"hall","9760":"juniors","8944":"palo alto high school","8953":"paly","9119":"Spirit Week","28800":"theme","9244":"Yellow"}},{"id":106876,"title":"Boys\u2019 water polo looks to improve despite construction obstacles","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/09\/04\/boys-water-polo-looks-to-improve-despite-construction-obstacles\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_106894\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"800\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/600By800BoysWopoPractice-150904.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-106894 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/600By800BoysWopoPractice-150904.jpg\" alt=\"The Palo Alto High School boys\u2019 water polo team executes some drills at the Rengstorff Pool in Mountain View during practice.

Photo by Cooper Lou.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Palo Alto High School boys\u2019 water polo team looks to overcome changes and improve on its second round exit from Central Coast Section last year as its season gets underway today with a non-league game.\r\n\r\nOne of the major changes this year for the Vikings will be that the team won\u2019t be able to play in a home pool. Instead, they have been practicing and playing at the Rengstorff Pool in Mountain View. Once the regular season begins, the team will play home games at Gunn High School\u2019s pool.\r\n\r\nAccording to senior right hand driver Winston Rosati, not having a home pool has been an nuisance.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt has been a big inconvenience in terms of logistics and has made certain practice drills much harder to do, but we can certainly do our best with it,\u201d Rosati said.\r\n\r\nNew head coach Aaron Johnson agreed that having no pool might be a hindrance, but he attributed a smooth transition to the new Paly athletic director and team parent.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt has definitely been a challenge not having our own pool this season, but we have not let it become a set-back,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cOur athletic director Kathleen Bowers and our team parent Kristen Anderson have done an amazing job making the transition go as smooth as possible. We are also grateful to be able to use Gunn High School as our home pool this year.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnother place the team has experienced change is at the coaching position.\u00a0Although Johnson is a new head coach, he has had some experience working with the Paly water polo team.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was previously the Paly Frosh\/Soph coach for the past few seasons, so when the varsity job opened up, I was ready to step in to the position,\" Johnson said. \u201cIt is something I have been looking forward to for quite some time.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to junior right hand driver Andrew Jozefov, Johnson\u2019s style will help the team get better this year.\r\n\r\n\u201cI really like his style,\u201d Jozefov said. \u201cIt is really structured which I feel is definitely going to help us. \u2026 He holds us to a high standard and expects us to be able to execute.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe team also lost a few key contributing seniors including Lucas Novak, Seth Alston, Ray Zhao, Hans Usman and Luke Schroder.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere were some really hard-working team leaders that graduated last year, which is a big loss to this team,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cLucas Novak redefined the role of captain. He was an amazing leader, positive influence on everyone around him and always pushed himself and teammates to be the best they can.\u201d\r\n\r\nHowever, Johnson believes that there are many players who are capable of stepping up to offset losses.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am however, lucky to have a lot of young talent coming up,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cOne in particular is Jack Anderson, a sophomore with a starting position on varsity. He is an underclassman with a big task.\"\r\n\r\nDespite the many changes, the team has set high goals.\r\n\r\n\u201cOur goals are to win SCVAL [Santa Clara Valley Athletic League] league and to get top three at CCS [Central Coast Sections],\u201d Rosati said.\r\n\r\nJozefov is using last year\u2019s disappointment to fuel himself this season.\r\n\r\n\u201cLast year we had a first round bye and got knocked out in the second round and that was pretty disappointing,\u201d Jozefov said. \u201cWe hope to get to the semis this year.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Johnson, the team has the right mindset and is excited to begin its season.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re going out focusing on winning one quarter at a time and playing consistent water polo. We are looking forward to getting this season rolling.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Viking\u2019s first game is against Jesuit High School at 7 p.m. today in Davis.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School boys\u2019 water polo team will look to overcome changes and improve on its second round exit from Central Coast Section last year as its season begins today with an out-of-league game.","date":"2015-09-04 16:55:11","author":"Chirag Akella","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/600By800BoysWopoPractice-1509041.jpg","categories":["Sports"],"tags":{"9845":"boys water polo","8568":"CCS","50763":"jesuit high school","12043":"new coach","9236":"Winston Rosati"}},{"id":106767,"title":"Liveblog: Football vs. Sequoia","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/09\/04\/liveblog-football-vs-sequoia\/","content":"Check back here beginning at 7:15 p.m. this Friday, Sept. 4 as the Palo Alto High School football team (0-0, 0-0) hosts the Sequoia High School Cherokees (0-0, 0-0) for it's first regular season game of the season.\r\n\r\n[liveblog]","excerpt":"Check back here beginning at 7:15 p.m. this Friday, Sept. 4 as the Palo Alto High School football team (0-0, 0-0) hosts the Sequoia High School Cherokees (0-0, 0-0) for it's first regular season game of the season.","date":"2015-09-04 13:18:21","author":"Josh Yuen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/Screen-Shot-2014-11-10-at-8.40.13-PM.png","categories":["Sports","Spotlight"],"tags":{"8714":"football","29126":"home opener","8855":"liveblog","25428":"sequoia"}},{"id":106292,"title":"Yearbook expands senior photo options","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/09\/03\/yearbook-expands-senior-photo-options\/","content":"This year, seniors will be able to submit their own photos for their yearbook portraits, greatly expanding their options from previous years.\r\n\r\nIn years prior, seniors were limited to paying for a professional photographer, using their student identification cards or attending a free session in which they were unable to chose their photo.\r\n\r\n\"I thought it [the old system] was good, but kind of overpriced,\" senior Courtney Lovely said.\r\n\r\nWith a new leadership team, Madrono is aiming to improve its photo submission policy.\r\n\r\n\"This year, we have [Madrono has] a new teacher, and we both agreed that it was ridiculous that people [felt pressured to] pay for their senior portraits so we decided that this year we would try a new method of doing it,\" Co-editor-in-chief, Blake Ragsdale said. \"We are really trying to redefine the yearbook, and this was one of the steps in order to redefine it.\"\r\n\r\nSeniors seem to enjoy this new option.\r\n\r\n\"I think allowing your own submissions is great,\" senior Alfredo Gonzalez said. \"It's good for people who want the freedom that a professional photo shoot has with location, but don't want to pay the price.\"\r\n\r\nThe photos must follow certain guidelines.\r\n\r\n\"They must be 4 inch by 5 inch, 300DPI, and a professional-looking photo, delivered to the yearbook classroom <span style=\"color: #545454;\">\u2013 Room\u00a0<\/span>101\u00a0<span style=\"color: #545454;\">\u2013<\/span> via USB after school on Tuesdays or Thursdays,\" Ragsdale said.\r\n\r\nPhotos will be due by Oct. 15, according to Madrono's photo guide.\r\n\r\nMouse around the Prezi to explore your portrait options.

Water polo is currently practicing at Rengstorff Park but will move to Gunn's pool in the coming weeks. According to volleyball head coach Jekira Wilson, the team will practice and play games in Gunn's old gym during the 2015 season.\r\n\r\nWilson said she took several days to complete the transition, ensuring that\u00a0the equipment was properly labeled and ready for transportation.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe change in location has only affected me in the sense of making sure all three teams [freshman, junior varsity and varsity] are all organized and getting to Gunn on time for practices and eventually matches,\u201d Wilson said.\r\n\r\nDue to the commute often taking upwards of 20 minutes to get to practice, Wilson's largest concern is giving players enough time to get their homework done.\r\n\r\nJunior volleyball setter Jessica Lee also agreed that having to travel across town is one of the biggest difficulties.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe location is a pain to get to every day,\" Lee said. \"You have to allow 30 minutes to get there every time.\"\r\n\r\nDespite disliking the relocation, Lee stays positive about the new gym construction.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate, but it\u2019s for the better for Paly athletics so we are paying it forward,\u201d Lee said.\r\n\r\nAnother major concern for Wilson is getting enough Paly \u00a0fans to attend home games.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe the move will affect the players' performance,\" Wilson said. \"I do encourage Paly student's however, to make it out to games\u2014 the girls will need the support.\u201d\r\n\r\nPaly Volleyball is not the only fall sport being affected by the gym construction. Water polo will is also facing \u00a0the challenges of no longer having a pool on campus.\r\n\r\nMuch like Lee, junior water polo player Alex Beaudry is also being affected time wise by the move to a new location.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe change allows for no procrastination,\" Beaudry said. \"Since practice is right after school and ends at around 6 p.m., there are no big blocks for me to do homework in.\"\r\n\r\nSome winter and spring sports including basketball, wrestling and badminton. will also have to move off campus during their respective seasons.\r\n\r\nOther than changes in location, Paly sports teams are settling into their groove. \"Gunn has been very accommodating and other than the giant \"G\" on the wall and the change in paint colors, we are very much making ourselves at home,\" Wilson said.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"Palo Alto High School's students, staff, coaches and parents are facing challenges brought on by recent construction projects, including the Big Gym's renovations and the pool's closure, which have caused many sports teams to relocate off-campus.\r\n","date":"2015-09-01 11:34:16","author":"Jackson Doerr","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/11911387_1807124139514151_1611859663_n1.jpg","categories":["Sports","Spotlight"],"tags":{"32738":"alex beaudry","49942":"beaudry","11286":"big gym","12358":"coach","8616":"construction","8751":"gunn","49940":"jekira wilson","8944":"palo alto high school","8953":"paly","9863":"pool","49939":"rinconada","9120":"sports","41060":"teams","38450":"update","9216":"volleyball","49938":"waterpolov","49941":"wilson"}}]
