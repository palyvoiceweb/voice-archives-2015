The father spoke more often than the children present: Jomana, Shaima, Ali and Hammody, who are all\u00a0less than 11 years old. Jomana, the eldest of the four, is learning German and hopes to enroll into school for 2016.<\/em>\r\n\r\nFather: \"We ran away from ISIS and the bombardment.\u00a0The children couldn't go to school, and the girls had to constantly wear a Hijab for their safety. The airplanes [Air Forces] bombed everywhere.\u00a0Our town was controlled by ISIS. They slaughtered people. There was bombardment by the air forces and houses were destroyed. There were no schools, and nowhere to go. They beat people, and they whipped people. Now that we're safe in Austria, we're going to stay here.\u00a0That is our situation, a tragic situation. Here in Europe, it's better and the kids can go to school.\"\r\n\r\nJomana, age 11: \"We went to the Turkish borders from Syria by a boat, and then we walked our way to Austria through Macedonia, Serbia and Greece.\"\r\n\r\nUpon request of the family, last names, photos and audio files are not available.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Interview #2<\/strong><\/span>\r\n\r\n[audio m4a=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/Arabic-1.m4a\"][\/audio]\r\n\r\n<em>Upon request of the individual,\u00a0his name is to be kept private but gender pronouns are allowed.

Initially en route to Germany, he decided to stay in Austria upon his arrival in Vienna, in hopes of building\u00a0a life in the city of Schwechat.<\/em>\r\n\r\n\"The journey took about 20 days. My situation was very bad, and I could not stay in Iraq. I was a normal citizen. I dared to take the risk and move to Austria since it is more secure for me. I swear to God, life is beautiful.

Al-Shamari will discuss everything from the refugee crisis in Western Europe to the cultural experience she\u2019s encountering in Vienna. She plans to\u00a0immerse herself into a new culture and share an international\u00a0perspective with Palo Alto High School through photos, interviews and travel updates.<\/em>\r\n\r\nWe are in the midst of one of the greatest population migrations in modern history. But given the recent attacks in France, Lebanon,\u00a0Iraq,\u00a0Russia and the\u00a0United States, many have\u00a0either stopped accepting refugees or enforced border control, which has elevated tensions\u00a0and created\u00a0widespread controversy among both citizens and the millions seeking asylum.\r\n\r\nIn late October, I\u00a0learned of\u00a0a nearby location in the\u00a0Vienna District of Austria that housed newly-arrived refugees. In an effort to shed light on the stifled experiences these\u00a0individuals\u00a0have gone through on their path to safety, I spoke with some of the refugees who came from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and Mongolia.\r\n\r\nI met with a total of 16 individuals who solely spoke Arabic or Farsi. It was my luck to have\u00a0met Hassan Kathem, an Iraqi refugee who spent\u00a0some time studying in Ukraine, learning\u00a0enough\u00a0Russian for the two of us to speak together. Kathem helped me communicate\u00a0with some of the refugees on a more personal level by translating the Arabic words of his fellow refugees to Russian.\r\n\r\nMany of these families have lost their homes and\u00a0loved ones during\u00a0traumatic events.\u00a0It is important to keep an open mind and heart as we\u00a0take a small glance into the world of stories held by those affected during\u00a0the\u00a0European\u00a0refugee crisis. Today,\u00a0regardless of language barriers, we have the opportunity to hear\u00a0the real voices of the refugee crisis. I look forward to sharing these stories with you\u00a0through a\u00a0three-part installment.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>My\u00a0translator, a refugee:<\/strong><\/span>\r\n\r\n<em>The first story I would like to share is with my Russian-Arabic translator, Hassan Kathem, who briefly studied in Ukraine\u00a0before returning to his home in Iraq. Shortly after his return, the national tension and chaos worsened in Iraq and his family told him to flee and leave them behind. With Kathem's help, I was able to speak to refugees\u00a0without any written translations, providing a link between two worlds.<\/em>\r\n\r\n[audio m4a=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/Arabic-3.m4a\"][\/audio]\r\n\r\n\"I'm Hassan Kathem and I come from Iraq. Before the war worsened, I studied in Ukraine for two years, learning Russian, which allows me to speak with some people in [Vienna], like you. The current situation in my country is not good and I am expecting it to get worse over the next 5 years. Now I\u2019m just living, away from the dangers of my home. \u00a0My journey was short: it took 8 days once I traveled from Turkey to Vienna. I feel secure. I expect life to be good through this year when I am in Vienna. I have 4 sisters and 4 brothers, but my family is not here, they are back in Iraq. As of now I\u2019m learning German.

As the lights dim, the students \u2013 now transformed into English peasants and princesses \u2013 begin to sing. Although the song's words are in Spanish, the rhythm transcends the language barrier and transports the audience to the year 1536.\r\n\r\nThe annual Madrigals Feaste brought medieval life to the stage at Jordan Middle School last weekend. A staple in the Palo Alto High School choirs\u2019 annual concerts, the feast\u00a0featured creative songs and a comedic plot, highlighting the choirs' talent and creativity.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The performance\u2019s plotline revolved around a royal family in medieval England. King Henry VIII (senior Ryan Jamison) has gathered the audience in celebration of his marriage to Queen Jane\u00a0(senior Lana Graves)\u00a0\u00a0after his previous wife was decapitated for bearing him a daughter instead of a son. Unfortunately for the family (and England\u2019s neighbors), Princess Elizabeth\u00a0is kidnapped on the day of Henry VIII\u00a0and Jane\u2019s marriage celebration. Fearing the King\u2019s wrath, Princess Mary (senior Luma Hamade),\u00a0and Queen Jane\u00a0search for the princess with the help of two comedic detectives, Lady Olivia\u00a0(senior Jenny Xin)\u00a0and Lord Elliot (sophomore Sam Kim) as well as a crier (junior Edward Park). The search includes a series of songs by the servants and royal family.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Madrigals\u2019 plot was amusing and included hilarious allusions to celebrities ranging from Taylor Swift to Donald Trump. (King Henry VIII\u00a0at one point threatens to \u201cbuild a wall\u201d around England.) The play was properly spaced so that\u00a0neither commentary nor songs dominated the Madrigals\u2019 entirety. In addition, a happy (yet unanticipated) ending properly concluded the play.<\/span>\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_113261\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"576\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/12188208_1530006023984891_8385678320505281814_o.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-113261\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/12188208_1530006023984891_8385678320505281814_o.jpg\" alt=\"12188208_1530006023984891_8385678320505281814_o\" width=\"576\" height=\"384\" \/><\/a> Sophomore Lucia Dong, junior Anisha Patwardhan, junior Soo Kim, junior Kaitlin Chiu and junior\u00a0Taylor Duncan perform a Christmas song at the Madrigal Feaste. The Feaste featured each choir singer, and included Christmas and Latin music.

Songs varied greatly, from the cheerful Christmas songs by Paly\u2019s acapella groups, to soulful tunes (some in a different language). Some songs that stood out included \"In My Little Picture Frame,\" which featured a shaker and melancholy tunes, \"Esta Noche Nace el Ni\u00f1o,\" led by soloist Graves, and \"Procession.\" In addition, many songs included soloists who guided the choir. The music made up a majority of the Feaste.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The concert\u2019s food was both plentiful and elegant. A three course meal began with sugary scones, ripe strawberries and\u00a0water and tea. The main course, cucumber sandwiches, was an appetizing meal\u00a0with fresh cucumbers and delectable bread. For dessert, various chocolate and candy pieces\u00a0left me feeling like royalty.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other aspects of the event were also a success. The set, which included a castle's background and Christmas wreaths, was minimalistic yet appropriate for a song-based play. The characters\u2019 costumes were elaborate and elegant, featuring 1500s trends and stylish caps and gowns. Each costume was unique and colorful, and a large effort appeared to have been put into their\u00a0design. Tables in the seating area were lavishly decorated, transporting the audience to the 16th century. A jester (Student Activities Director Matthew Hall) also performed entertaining juggling tricks with balls and blocks of wood that left the crowd laughing at his antics.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the singing was superb and the plot entertaining, Madrigals was longer than necessary (about 2 and a half hours)\u00a0and it was difficult to concentrate for the duration of the performance. However, the characters consistently mentioned audience members and an auction mid-way through kept everyone engaged.<\/span>","excerpt":"The annual Madrigals Feaste brought medieval life to the stage at Jordan Middle School this past weekend.

With her latest record \u201c25\u201d \u2013 released Nov. 20 \u2013 she creates a springboard to further recognition on the charts, the radio and at award shows around the world.\r\n\r\n\u201c25\u201d is a breath of fresh air. It\u2019s unmistakably Adele, spotlighting her signature soulful sound we\u2019ve grown to love. The familiar high notes heard on past hits \"Rolling in the Deep\" and \"Someone Like You\" are present in many of her latest songs. Yet with\u00a0a foot in this familiar territory, Adele ventures into styles of music foreign\u00a0to previous albums. Her third studio album experiments with various electronic elements and dips lightly\u00a0into folk music. These risks are a result of various influences that Adele experienced while writing \"25.\"\r\n\r\n\u201cI was exposed to a lot of country, rockabilly and bluegrass because I was touring for such a long time,\u201d Adele said in <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thesun.co.uk\/sol\/homepage\/showbiz\/music\/3732379\/Adeles-up-for-some-grass.html\">an interview with The Sun<\/a>. \u201cThe melodies and to-the-point lyrics I have found in a lot of American styles of music is definitely something I'm going be pursuing heavily from now on.\u201d\r\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" style=\"background: #FFF; border: 0; border-radius: 3px; box-shadow: 0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width: 658px; padding: 0; width: calc(100% - 2px);\" data-instgrm-version=\"6\">\r\n<div style=\"padding: 8px;\">\r\n<div style=\"background: #F8F8F8; line-height: 0; margin-top: 40px; padding: 35.9259259259% 0; text-align: center; width: 100%;\">\r\n<div style=\"background: url(data:image\/png; base64,ivborw0kggoaaaansuheugaaacwaaaascamaaaapwqozaaaagfbmveuiiii9pt0ehh4gib4hibkchbwchbwchbydr+jqaaaachrstlmaba4yhyqsm5jtamwaaadfsurbvdjl7zvbegmhcaqbaf\/\/42xcnbpaqakcm0ftumfaaibe81iqbjds3ls6zs3bipb9wed3yyxfpmhrft8sgyrcp1x8ueuxlmznwelfoycv6mhwwwmzdpekhlhlw7nwjqkhc4uizphavdza2jpzudsbzzinae2s6owh8xpmx8g7zzgkeopuoyhvgz1tbcxmkd3kwnvbu0gkhkx+izilf77iofhry1nyfnb\/lqpb79drwoyjva\/davg9b\/rlb4cc+nqgdz\/tvbbbnr6gbreqn\/nrmdgaqeej7whonozjf+y2i\/fzou\/qaaaaaelftksuqmcc); display: block; height: 44px; margin: 0 auto -44px; position: relative; top: -22px; width: 44px;\">\r\n<p style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px; margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 8px; overflow: hidden; padding: 8px 0 7px; text-align: center; text-overflow: ellipsis; white-space: nowrap;\"><a style=\"color: #c9c8cd; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/-PDH4nAfHA\/\" target=\"_blank\">A photo posted by @adele<\/a> on <time style=\"font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 17px;\" datetime=\"2015-11-18T17:49:21+00:00\">Nov 18, 2015 at 9:49am PST<\/time><\/p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n<script src=\"\/\/platform.instagram.com\/en_US\/embeds.js\" async=\"\" defer=\"defer\"><\/script>Touching on topics from nostalgia\u00a0to motherhood, the songs form a cohesive underlying theme: self-reflection. Each of the 11 tracks tells a distinct story, portraying a different angle of Adele's growth as understood\u00a0by Adele herself. This deep level of understanding is arguably what makes her songs such huge hits. Because her\u00a0ability to translate\u00a0her emotions into song\u00a0is so powerful, listeners themselves begin to self-reflect too.\r\n\r\nIn <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Adele\/status\/656787881349009408\">an open letter<\/a> to her fans, the star shares the background of \"25\" and how she defines this album.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy last record was a break-up record and if I had to label this one, I would call it a make-up record,\u201d Adele writes. \u201cI\u2019m making up with myself. Making up for lost time. Making up for everything I ever did and never did. \u2026 And I\u2019m sorry it took so long, but you know, life happened.\u201d\r\n\r\nHere is our take on four notable songs of \"25.\"\r\n<iframe width=\"700\" height=\"1228\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"overflow-y:hidden;\" src=\"https:\/\/magic.piktochart.com\/embed\/9256933-hello\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\n\u201c25\u201d was met with groundbreaking success, selling 3.38 million copies in the United States in the first week alone. No artist has ever come close to this incredible feat, with the second fastest-selling album at 2.42 million for NSYNC's \"No Strings Attached,\" according to Nielsen SoundScan Tracking. \"25\"\u00a0soared to No. 1 on the iTunes album chart within seconds after its release, and by the second day, all 11 tracks individually secured spots in the Top 30s of the iTunes singles chart.\r\n\r\nPerhaps this achievement is due in part to Adele withholding \"25\" from music streaming platforms such as Spotify and Apple Music. In an industry where <a href=\"http:\/\/www.billboard.com\/articles\/business\/6627139\/nielsen-2015-half-year-report-detail-taylor-swift-streaming\" target=\"_blank\">music streaming is growing<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/hughmcintyre\/2014\/08\/30\/us-album-sales-hit-new-all-time-low\/\" target=\"_blank\">album sales are at an all time low<\/a>, this decision may have led casual fans to purchase the album. Adele had also initially withheld her previous album, \"21,\" from Spotify because she wanted to limit the songs to paying subscribers.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_113235\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"324\"]<img class=\"wp-image-113235\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/DSC_6305edit.jpg\" alt=\"DSC_6305edit\" width=\"324\" height=\"216\" \/> \"25\" is Adele's third studio album. According to an interview with British radio DJ Nick Grimshaw, Adele had scrapped an album about motherhood because it was \"too boring.\" \"It took me a long time to focus on how I wanted to write and what I wanted to write about,\" she said. Photo by Jeanette Wong.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nOn Oct. 23, 2015, Adele\u2019s first single in three years, \u201cHello,\u201d was dropped world-wide and was an instant success. On Vevo, the music video generated the highest number of views in a 24-hour span (27.7 million) and was the fastest video to reach 100 million views. The single entered the Billboard chart at No. 1, with 1,112,000 digital downloads in its first week.\r\n\r\nAdele released her debut album, \"19,\" on Jan. 28, 2008 and it was nominated for numerous accolades including a Mercury Prize and the Grammy Award for Best New Artist. Three years later, Adele dropped her second album, \"21,\" which won the 2012 Grammy Award for Album of the Year and the Brit Award for British Album of the Year.\r\n\r\nWith \"25,\" it should come to no surprise if she racks up another host of awards.","excerpt":"A phenomenal singer-songwriter whose accolades extend beyond Grammy Awards, Academy Awards and world records, Adele Adkins is no stranger to success.

Seniors Justin Hull and Mikey Grandy and sophomores Paul Jackson, Bryant Jefferson and Max Dorward were completing their football season, as the Vikings continued into the CCS <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/12\/02\/season-recap-football-falls-in-ccs-semi-final-to-milpitas\/\">semi-finals<\/a> and were unable to practice with the basketball team. However, Simison says this obstacle shouldn\u2019t affect the team too drastically.\r\n\r\n\u201cThose players will cause setbacks, but eventually we will be back to normal or even better than before,\u201d Simison said.\r\n\r\nThe team lost key scorers Kevin Mullin and John Rojahn to graduation, according to Diepenbrock. However, Diepenbrock said he believes this will provide an opportunity for the team to discover new talented players.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey both were very good seniors who scored a lot of the points,\u201d Diepenbrock said. \u201cOne of our challenges is going to be finding out who are going to be our scorers \u2014 that's a big void we are going to have to fill.\u201d\r\n\r\nSimison stated that he thinks this year\u2019s team is filled with great players who can be successful.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe team this year is a solid group,\" Simison said. \"I am proud to be playing with the selected players this year.\u201d\r\n\r\nDiepenbrock reiterated this thought and is entering the season hoping for success.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey are a very unselfish team and I think we are going to have a strong team chemistry,\u201d Diepenbrock said. \u201c I think it's a good group and I have very high expectations.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe team will take on Piedmont Hills High School at 5 p.m. tonight\u00a0in San Jose in its first game of the season.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School boys' basketball team looks to achieve a great season with a former star coach and its group of talented players.","date":"2015-12-10 14:54:31","author":"Chayenne Greenberg","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/12363982_1716894831874746_346671881_o-3.jpg","categories":["Sports"],"tags":["boys basketball","bryant jefferson","Jack Simison","john rojan","justin hull","kevin mullin","max dorward","mikey grandy","palo alto vikings","paul jackson","Peter Diepenbrock","piedmont hills high school"]},{"id":112766,"title":"Wrestling looks to rebuild in new season","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/12\/10\/wrestling-looks-to-rebuild-in-new-season\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_113053\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"598\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/Screen-Shot-2015-12-08-at-8.58.50-AM.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-113053\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/Screen-Shot-2015-12-08-at-8.58.50-AM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-12-08 at 8.58.50 AM\" width=\"598\" height=\"413\" \/><\/a> Palo Alto high School junior Seth Goyal attacks junior Emilio Bautista of Half Moon Bay High School at the Peninsula Varsity Tournament on Dec. 5.

Image credits 5sos.com.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n5 Seconds of Summer\u2019s 'Sounds Good Feels Good' is the perfect blend between Green Day and One Direction, combining the sounds of punk and pop to appeal to a wide market of listeners. This album is full of teen angst, incorporating catchy chants and simple melodies to make the songs enjoyable to listen to. However, the songs can become quite repetitive after a couple listens. If you\u2019re looking for fun pop-punk album then it\u2019s well worth the buy.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/embed.spotify.com\/?uri=spotify:album:3QblxoryrPYjRXFkucv0Sp\" width=\"300\" height=\"80\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\n<strong>Made in the A.M. - One Direction<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Rating: 8.5\/10<\/strong>\r\n<strong>Best songs of the album:<\/strong>\r\n\"What A Feeling,\" \"Drag Me Down,\" \"Infinity\"\r\n<strong>Worst song of the album<\/strong>\r\n\"Olivia\"\r\n\r\nOne Direction\u2019s first album without former member Zayn Malik, and last one before their hiatus, could very well be their best yet. Classic One Direction songs such as \"What A Feeling\" and \"Drag Me Down\" compose the majority of the album, yet don\u2019t sound completely rehashed like some of their previous songs. New styles of sound like \"Temporary Fix,\" which put a punk-pop twist on the typical One Direction sound keep the album fresh and exciting. The album hits very few lows, and even the worst songs are easy to listen to. One Direction is ending their tenure as the #1 pop band in the world on an incredibly high note, and hopefully we will get to see more songs sooner rather than later.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/embed.spotify.com\/?uri=spotify%3Auser%3A1216334347%3Aplaylist%3A4OkUksyk0jM2wGAyOOhcHl\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\n<strong>25 - Adele\u00a0<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Rating: 10\/10<\/strong>\r\n<strong>Best songs of the album<\/strong>\r\n\"Hello,\" \"I Miss you*,\" \"When We Were Young,*\" \"Remedy*\"\r\n<strong>Worst Song of the album<\/strong>\r\nLet's be honest here, we couldn't pick one if we had to.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_112891\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"250\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/adele-25-packshot1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-112891 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/adele-25-packshot1.jpg\" alt=\"adele-25-packshot\" width=\"250\" height=\"250\" \/><\/a> \"25\" is breaking records after 3.38 million copies were sold in the first week, despite Adele's decision to not make it available on streaming services. Many believe Adele's third album has exceeded the already lofty expectations that many set after her critically acclaimed first two albums \"19\" and \"25.\" Image credits to Adele.com.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAdele\u2019s much anticipated '25' is simply beautiful, matching the high bar set by her previous albums '19' and '21' in this 11 song masterpiece. The album has a unique modern sound similar to '21', but still comes across as new and fresh. Powerful ballads such as \"Hello\" and \"I Miss You\" leave you speechless, while upbeat songs such as \"Water Under the Bridge\" and \"Sweetest Devotion\" help balance out the melancholy feel to the album. If there is one flaw, it's that the album is not available on streaming services and instead must be purchased. If you want to get over a breakup, move on from a loved one, or if you\u2019re just looking for some good music to get you through rough times, this album will not disappoint.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/embed.spotify.com\/?uri=spotify%3Auser%3A1216334347%3Aplaylist%3A0NroRTICZ5pqVQgZdBW0oY\" width=\"300\" height=\"80\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>\r\n*Not on Spotify\r\n\r\n<strong>Purpose - Justin Bieber<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Rating: 8\/10<\/strong>\r\n<strong>Best songs of the album:<\/strong>\r\n\"Love Yourself,\" \"Sorry,\" \"What Do You Mean?\"\r\n<strong>Worst songs of the album:<\/strong>\r\n\"Get Used To It\"\r\n\r\nJustin Bieber is back.

Alessia Cara may only be 19 years old, but her album embodies maturity in its relatable lyrics, soulful tone and her powerful voice.\u00a0There is still room for improvement for Cara to find her distinct sound because she has incorporated many different genres into her music, but this debut album deserves applause.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/embed.spotify.com\/?uri=spotify%3Auser%3A1216334347%3Aplaylist%3A0SnDHgkYEs3kWoGhyu7ngB\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>","excerpt":"The Paly Voice rated November's top albums from some of the world's biggest superstars and bands.
