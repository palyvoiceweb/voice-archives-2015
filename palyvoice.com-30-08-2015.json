Others participated in specialized programs at universities, enriching themselves in debate, theatre, business or music.\r\n\r\nFor 13 Palo Alto High School and Gunn High School students, however, the summer was filled with interviews, hard-hitting questionnaires and mental health awareness within their local community.\r\n\r\nAfter\u00a0a series of teen suicides last year, Paly seniors Christian Leong and Andrew Baer embarked on a five-month journey to capture the effect of mental health issues on their community.\r\n\r\nIn late May, they gathered a team of 13 students, naming themselves \u201cDocumenting our Community about X topics\u201d or the \u201cDocX\u201d team. June marked the creation of their storyboard while July turned their vision into reality \u2014 filming. Five months later, after the release of a trailer\u00a0(see\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-1kPAVxkPmE\">here<\/a>); the team is ready to premiere the entirety of their film at 6:30 p.m. Sept. 12 at the Palo Alto Children\u2019s Theater.\r\n\r\nAccording to Baer, the documentary is a direct response to the teen suicides in Palo Alto, serving as a way to spark conversation between youth and adults, break the stigma around mental health and inspire hope throughout the community.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe want as many people in the community to see the film because it\u2019s really a community issue,\" Baer said. \"It\u2019s not just school or students or teens.\u201d\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_106322\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"355\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/11728994_1615094048747922_522563832245246603_o.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-106322\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/11728994_1615094048747922_522563832245246603_o.jpg\" alt=\"11728994_1615094048747922_522563832245246603_o\" width=\"355\" height=\"355\" \/><\/a> Directors Andrew Baer and Christian Leong work throughout the summer in Baer's house to film and edit their documentary. \"My friend Christian [Leong] and I wanted to take action and make a positive difference,\" Baer said. Photo by Yui Sasajima.[\/caption]The film is a \u201cquasi-documentary,\u201d intertwining a mix of fiction and nonfiction elements, according to Leong.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt gives a backstory of what happened last year,\u201d Leong said. \u201cIt then moves on to what we can do moving forward about the issue while also giving a fictional storyline.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe narrative aspect of the documentary tells the story of a fabricated high school student, \u201cWinston,\u201d played by Paly senior Daniel Cottrell. According to Baer, the character\u2019s setting and personal life remain vague in order to illustrate a relatable character experiencing something difficult.\r\n\r\n\u201cHis\u00a0[Winston's]\u00a0purpose is to provide the emotional aspect of the film that you can\u2019t really get through the documentary,\u201d Baer said.\r\n\r\nThe nonfictional component of the film contains interviews with students, teachers and mental health professionals. Seniors Carolyn Walworth, Bryn Carlson and Leslie Garcia share their stories in each respective interview. Paly math teacher Herb Bocksnick and English teacher Shirley Tokheim voice their opinions as well.\r\n\r\nOther interviews include Supt. Max McGee; Chris Sturgeon, a youth pastor at Menlo Park Presbyterian Church; Dr. Shashank Joshi, a Stanford medical psychologist; and V<span style=\"color: #373e4d;\">assi Johri, D<\/span>irector of health and wellness at\u00a0REACH Ashland Youth Center in San Leandro, which offers support services for teenagers.\r\n\r\nFor the team, the interviews not only provided strong components to the documentary but also added to the filmmakers\u2019 understanding of the topic as a whole.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe whole interview process was also a learning process,\u201d Baer said.\r\n\r\nAccording to Leong, the most difficult aspect of the interviews was dealing with the sensitivity of the topic.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou really have to be careful in the wording when you reach out to different interviewees and as a team,\u201d\u00a0Leong said.\r\n\r\nTo ensure consideration, the filmmakers carefully followed the standardized requirements for filmmaking provided by the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.afsp.org\/\">American Foundation for Suicide Prevention<\/a>, specifically in regards to word choice and glorification, according to Leong.\r\n\r\nThe documentary also cites information, ranging from teenage involvement in community issues to sources of stress,\u00a0that was gathered\u00a0from local high school students through online surveys composed by the filmmakers. Open-ended questions included:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Which of the following causes you stress?<\/li>\r\n\t<li>What is your definition of hope?<\/li>\r\n\t<li>What do you suggest the district do to support teen voice?<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Is teen voice being heard in the community?<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\u201cWe really valued the data because we thought it could give a good sample size of what people in our class really thought of the issue,\u201d Leong said.\r\n\r\nPrior to the creation of \u201cUnmasked,\u201d directors Leong and Baer had separate experiences with filmmaking. Leong took video production courses at Paly and attended a two-week course at Occidental College\u00a0for its School of Creative and Performing Arts. Baer, on the other hand, gained his film expertise through his father, who is involved with\u00a0the filmmaking industry.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust making movies for fun has been something I\u2019ve done,\u201d Baer said.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_106326\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"633\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/11143417_1610557845868209_4430432207647122128_n.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-106326\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/11143417_1610557845868209_4430432207647122128_n.jpg\" alt=\"11143417_1610557845868209_4430432207647122128_n\" width=\"633\" height=\"356\" \/><\/a> Senior Daniel Cottrell plays the role of \"Winston,\" a teenage boy struggling with depression who appears in the fictional part of the documentary.

This is the new Tutorial, at least for now.\r\n\r\nWith the start of the 2015-16 school year, Paly administrators have instituted punitive measures for failing to attend\u00a0Tutorial, an hour-long block on T days, initially created to give students a\u00a0time to learn outside of the classroom.\r\n\r\nAccording to Principal Kim Diorio, when the bell schedule was established five years ago, Tutorial was envisioned to be a mandatory instructional time built for getting extra help, catching up on homework or talking with teachers.\r\n\r\n\u201cUnfortunately, our efforts in the beginning when we first launched Tutorial did not measure with students as originally intended,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cStudents then didn\u2019t see the value in it.\u201d\r\n\r\nLegally, however, the Western Association of Schools and Colleges and the educational code\u00a0for California\u00a0both view Tutorial as instructional time with mandatory attendance, according to Diorio. Not only is the school required to be teaching, but if a student is harmed off-campus, the school assumes responsibility.\r\n\r\nWith that, freshmen and sophomores have been assigned to their Teacher Advisor in hopes of fostering a stronger relationship between student and adult, while juniors and seniors have been assigned to a Tutorial class of approximately 12 students, Diorio said.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe want to encourage those relationships between students and their Teacher Advisors,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to build a climate of care in our campus.\u201d\r\n\r\nTutorial will provide another opportunity\u00a0for teachers\u00a0to check-in with students and let them know that the administrators and staff are here to support them, according to Diorio. If students do not sign in to their designated class, they will receive a \u201ccut\u201d and their parents will be notified. If students are found not using the time wisely, administrators will approach them, according to Diorio.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_106009\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"364\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/Screen-Shot-2015-08-23-at-8.32.19-PM.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-106009\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/Screen-Shot-2015-08-23-at-8.32.19-PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-08-23 at 8.32.19 PM\" width=\"364\" height=\"153\" \/><\/a> If students\u00a0fail to sign in to\u00a0Tutorial, they will receive an \"unknown absence\" on Infinite Campus and their parents will be notified.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n\u201cI think what\u2019s most likely to happen is having administrators, campus supervisors or counselors out at the exit-entry points at campus saying, 'Hey, where are you going,'\u201d Diorio said. \u201cWe\u2019d like for you to stay on campus.\u201d\r\n\r\nDespite the disciplinary\u00a0measures, Diorio has high hopes for the future of Tutorial, seeking to rebrand it as a \"gift of time\" to learn a new skill.\r\n\r\nStudents can complete school-related work, whether it be by meeting for a group project, completing college applications, talking to a teacher or doing homework. For those who do not have such work, Diorio seeks to create Tutorial activities that include meditation, yoga, student-guided workshops, teacher-mediated activities or speakers.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019d love to see us use that hour as a time where everyone is learning,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t need that extra hour to work \u2026 maybe this is an hour where you can do something fun, creative and learn something new. Just for the sake of learning \u2014 no grades or points attached.\u201d\r\n\r\nJunior Jackson Kienitz, who has attended Paly since his freshman year, looks forward to the additional activities provided during Tutorial.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt gives students the chance to try new things without the long-term commitment of signing up for a class,\u201d Kienitz said.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are changes to Tutorial this year, the administration is aware that every student utilizes the allotted Tutorial hour in his or her\u00a0own way.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are trying to be really mindful in how we improve Tutorial,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cWe\u2019re calling it Tutorial 2.0.\u201d\r\n\r\nDiorio also plans to use the attendance trends to assist students who are struggling. The application \u201cTrackavike\u201d gives administration and faculty the ability to scan students into their desired Tutorial class, and thus track which\u00a0classroom each\u00a0student has signed into.\r\n\r\nAccording to Diorio, administrators will be able to see \u201cwhere kids need additional\u00a0help, what classrooms they want to go to, and \u2026 when students are struggling to see how they have been managing their time.\u201d If a student has been struggling in math but has been attending their history Tutorial, for example, counselors can immediately recognize the problem.\r\n\r\nFrom a student\u2019s perspective, some are angry\u00a0about\u00a0the change, in part\u00a0because juniors and seniors\u00a0must walk far\u00a0to check-in with an unfamiliar teacher.\r\n\r\n\"Everyone is just upset that they have to walk across campus to a random classroom,\" junior Nathaniel Hancock said.\r\n\r\nKienitz believes the issue will soon pass, as students just need time to get acquainted with\u00a0the mandatory attendance system.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think the discontent with mandatory Tutorials is a temporary problem,\u201d Kienitz said. \u201cIt\u2019s simply a matter of getting used to it.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe administration looks forward to giving students an additional hour to learn, according to Diorio.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take some time to shift that, for students to understand the value of Tutorial as we see it,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cBut we think there\u2019s value in it, or else we wouldn\u2019t have given it up as instructional time in this thing we call Tutorial.\u201d","excerpt":"With the start of the 2015-16 school year, Paly administrators have instituted punitive measures for failing to attend Tutorial, an hour-long block on T days.","date":"2015-08-25 15:01:27","author":"Adele Bloch","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/MG_8132-2.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"8458":"administration","8644":"diorio","47579":"jackson","47580":"jackson kienitz","44647":"kim","8834":"Kim Diorio","47578":"mandatory","8953":"paly","47581":"ta","47582":"teacher advisor","11060":"tutorial"}},{"id":106087,"title":"Slideshow: Annual art fair floods community with color","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/08\/25\/slideshow-annual-art-fair-floods-community-with-color\/","content":"The 34th Palo Alto Festival of the Arts submerged downtown Palo Alto in color as hundreds of California artists convened for the annual event on Saturday and Sunday.\r\n\r\nThe festival featured over 300 artists from across the state who filled University Avenue with art including ceramics, watercolor, photography and sculptures.
