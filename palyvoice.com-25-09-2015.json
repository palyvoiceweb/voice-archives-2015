Advanced Authentic Research,\u00a0a new student research program, will also provide students with the opportunity\u00a0to carry out experiments, though they will be responsible for designing their own research.\u00a0\"A program where high schoolers can create their own thesis and research a topic of their choosing would be beneficial towards a student's education\u00a0and interesting for students,\" Cummings said. Photo by Adrienne Kwok.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe application deadline for Advanced Authentic Research, a program that will allow Palo Alto Unified School District high school students to showcase their applied research skills in a variety of academic subjects, is approaching on Sept. 25.\r\n\r\nAccording to AAR Coordinator Jeong Choe, students will be responsible for creating a specific thesis and researching their own\u00a0topics. Students can conduct \u00a0research on a multitude of themes, including history, psychology, business and sports.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe program is a unique opportunity for students in grades 10-12,\u201d Choe said. \u201cIt is designed for students with interest, passion, curiosity and perseverance to investigate an authentic topic of their choosing.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn addition, students will be paired with a mentor knowledgeable in the chosen area of research, according to Choe.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey [Mentors] will support and facilitate each student\u2019s work in their own laboratories, offices and other settings,\u201d Choe said. \u201cIf students are conducting surveys, they may be at another place. If students are doing computational work, the place may be flexible.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis year, students will participate in the program on their own time after school or during the weekend this year, but starting next year the program will be incorporated into a 7th Period class, according to PAUSD\u00a0Deputy Supt.\u00a0Markus Autrey.\r\n\r\nStudents will receive 10 Career Technical Education school credits for completing the program and working for a minimum of 60 hours per semester, though the scheduling is flexible. The class is pass or fail, according to Choe, and progress report will be collected from participants\u00a0in February.\r\n\r\n\u201cSome students may choose to spend more time than this based on their development of interests and passion in their research project,\u201d Choe said.\r\n\r\nWhile the program is similar to Paly\u2019s Science Research Project program, AAR is not limited to science-related topics.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can view AAR as an expansion of SRP,\u201d Choe said. \u201cSRP has a science focus and a lab component is a crucial piece. In AAR, we are giving opportunities to all the other disciplines.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Choe, students will begin researching their topics in October and finalize their findings in May.\r\n\r\nBoth Paly and Gunn High School are providing the program for its inaugural year.\r\n\r\nGunn High School AAR liaison Angela Merchant says\u00a0AAR is an excellent program for students.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are looking forward to organizing and implementing this great opportunity for kids,\u201d Merchant said.\r\n\r\nApplications are due through an email to Choe at jchoe@pausd.org.

The game will kick off at 7:30 p.m. on Friday, Sept. 25.\r\n\r\nLast Friday, the Vikings were able to keep up with the Monarchs for nearly three quarters, tying the game at 28 apiece on a connection between senior quarterback Justin Hull and senior wide receiver Riley Schoeben midway through the third quarter. The Monarchs, who came into the game ranked 54th in California, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.maxpreps.com\/high-schools\/archbishop-mitty-monarchs-(san-jose,ca)\/football\/home.htm\">MaxPreps.com<\/a>, closed the game with 24 unanswered points, slamming the door on any hopes of an upset by the Vikings.\r\n\r\nSenior captain and wide receiver Eli Givens is optimistic that the return of a number of injured players this week will provide a boost on the defensive side.\r\n\r\n\"We just need our injured players that didn't play last week to step up and help us out on defense,\" Givens said.\r\n\r\nThe Eagles, led by junior quarterback Tyler McGovern and senior running back Rasaan Fontenette, had a bye week this past week after being shut out by Valley Christian High School (3-0, 0-0) 24-0 on Sept. 11. Despite noticeable offensive struggles from the team, Fontenette has averaged 182 rushing yards per game through two games this season, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.maxpreps.com\/high-schools\/oak-grove-eagles-(san-jose,ca)\/football\/stats.htm\">MaxPreps.com<\/a>.\r\n\r\nGivens stressed that executing on both sides of the ball will be key for the Vikings.\r\n\r\n\"I think we will be able to pass and get some good run plays against Oak Grove and if our defense plays to its full potential then we will take care of them,\" Givens said.\r\n\r\nThe matchup will be the final game of the Vikings' non-conference schedule, as the team will begin De Anza League play a week later on Oct. 2 against Saratoga High School (1-2, 0-0).

If we continue to work hard and play strategically, I think we have a good shot at making it to CCS.\"\r\n\r\nDespite high hopes, Harader stresses the difficult\u00a0competition in the De Anza League, which the team moved up to this year.\r\n\r\n\"Our league is the best in NorCal [Northern California] and Central California, loaded with highly ranked players, so [the league is] extremely difficult,\" Harader said. \"We have several ranked players but just not as high.\"\r\n\r\nWang sees room for improvement as the team adjusts to the intense\u00a0competitiveness\u00a0of the league.\r\n\r\n\"I think we can still improve in regards to our aggressiveness in match play,\" Wang said. \"Since we moved up from a lower league last year, many of us are still determining how to approach opponents who aren't afraid to attack quickly, but I definitely think we will improve as the team gains more experience\"\r\n\r\nThe Viking's next match is against Homestead High School (3-0, 1-0) at 3:30 p.m. today at home.\r\n\r\n\"I know that our team is hungry for a league win, so we have a good shot at beating Homestead,\" Wang said.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School girls' tennis team (0-2, 6-4) looks to improve upon its league record after winning the Paly Invitational Tennis Tournament on Saturday.","date":"2015-09-22 15:32:34","author":"Takaaki Sagawa","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/IMG_2332.jpg","categories":["Sports"],"tags":{"56278":"andy","56281":"autumn","56280":"captain","12358":"coach","8693":"Fall","41285":"girl","8734":"girls","56279":"harder","56282":"invitaitonal","56277":"kelsey","8939":"palo alto","9120":"sports","10016":"tennis","9175":"tournament","9223":"Wang"}}]
