Screenshot by Daniel Li.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nTwo Palo Alto High School students are actively publicizing a new iPhone app For Paly sports, \"The Vike,\" after launching the service earlier this month.\r\n\r\nJunior Brian Tracy and senior Matthew Seligson created \u201cThe Vike\u201d to give students quick and easy access to Paly's varsity\u00a0sports team's schedules.\r\n\r\nThe app was originally designed to track the availability of Paly sports facilities, but later turned into a scheduling app for all Paly sports, according to Tracy.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn the past, whenever Matthew and I wanted to go to Paly to practice lacrosse or soccer, we ran the risk of showing up and having a team playing on the same field we wanted to use,\u201d Tracy said. \u201cOriginally, the only purpose of the app was to tell if a certain field was being used, saving people the effort of getting all the way to Paly only to realize they have to go home. From there, it spun off into a more comprehensive scheduling app not just for the fields, but for every sport.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Tracy, \"The Vike\" started off as a project for their Advanced Placement Computer Science class last year.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe [Tracy and Seligson] decided to develop the app continuously through the rest of the year and into the summer,\u201d Tracy said. \u201cWe finally finished it off early this school year.\u201d\r\n\r\nTracy said that he and Seligson faced many challenges throughout the development process.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe programming itself is quite difficult, but that is another issue,\u201d Tracy said. \u201cA big challenge was finding a reliable resource that we could pull data from to deliver the kind of information you see in the app.\u201d\r\n\r\nTracy encourages users to check out other features in the app.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy personal two favorite features of the app are the slideshow of all the sports and the 'Take Me Here' feature,\u201d Tracy said. \u201cThe slideshow acts as an alternative to the boring list of sports to choose from. To actually see students play each sport is a nice way to display the necessary information. Secondly, the 'Take Me Here' feature is for people who want to go to any away games. 'The Vike' makes it really easy to get directions to all of our away games by integrating with Apple Maps.\u201d\r\n\r\nCurrently, \"The Vike\" is only available on iOS devices.","excerpt":"Two Palo Alto High School students are actively publicizing a new iPhone app For Paly sports, \"The Vike,\" after launching the service earlier this month.","date":"2015-09-27 20:49:10","author":"Daniel Li","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/IMG_1750.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":{"11978":"app","32581":"brian tracy","11983":"Matthew Seligson","8944":"palo alto high school","8953":"paly","9120":"sports","56305":"sports app","56303":"the vike","56304":"vike"}},{"id":108638,"title":"ASB announces Homecoming details","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/09\/27\/asb-announces-homecoming-details-2\/","content":"<iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/d\/embed?mid=z6di7IKPG2fc.kEhvuGiY5vvU\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #444444;\">Palo Alto High School's Associated Student Body is implementing major changes to the location of its upcoming Homecoming dance, which will be held from 7 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Oct. 24,\u00a0according to\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1qdp57yv5xtilt_OT4Fhy_sIUVkGxotcJQePbjMJaBZ0\/edit\">Paly ASB meeting minutes<\/a><span style=\"color: #444444;\">.<\/span>\r\n\r\nWith the demolition of the <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/09\/02\/video-big-gym\/\">small and big gyms<\/a><span style=\"color: #444444;\">,<\/span>\u00a0Paly no longer had a viable location to house the annual dance.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe were only allowed to look at locations inside of Palo Alto,\u201d Junior Class Vice President Natalie Maloney said. \u201cWe tried looking at Lucie Stern, but that couldn\u2019t hold enough people.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs ASB tried to look for locations within Palo Alto, many were already in use\u00a0or could not hold enough people, according to Maloney.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe majority of the issues that we came into with looking at different venues was that they were either booked the day we needed it ... or it wasn\u2019t big enough for what we wanted, which had to hold 700 to 800 people,\u201d Maloney said.\r\n\r\nThe inability to find a location in Palo Alto forced ASB to look outside of Palo Alto to find a venue, according to Maloney.\r\n\r\n\u201cAfter talking to the district about our budget, they gave us some money to use and let us look outside of the Palo Alto range, into Mountain View, Los Altos, neighboring cities, and then we found the Computer History Museum which worked out really well,\u201d Maloney said.\r\n\r\nThe move to the Computer History Museum doesn\u2019t come without its own problems, however. One of the main issues students will face is getting to the museum. ASB plans\u00a0to have a limited number of buses for students who cannot get there by themselves, but also encourages students\u00a0to carpool and drive themselves, legally that is, according to Maloney.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are encouraging upperclassmen to drive and any sophomore who is able to legally drive,\u201d Maloney said. \"Obviously we are going to try and get everyone there\u00a0with the buses but the more people that don\u2019t drive, the more expensive it\u2019s going to be. We\u2019d rather save that money to have better food and better decorations.\u201d\r\n\r\nTickets are $15 without an ASB card and $10 with one.

Callan chose volleyball as her sport after growing a passion to be the best. \"It's frustrating when you see all these girls who can hit really hard and they can jump really high and you keep making mistakes,\" Callan said. \"So I started working with a private coach and I took notes of the things he said, I have a whole notebook at home. I reviewed those before every time before I play.\"[\/caption]This week, The Paly Voice sat down with freshman volleyball player Ashlyn Callan to discuss how she made varsity, how the upperclassmen treat her and of course, volleyball.\n\nThe Paly Voice: You made varsity volleyball your freshman year, congratulations. How did you prepare for your tryouts mentally and physically?\n\nAshlyn Callan: This whole summer I have been doing a bunch of different camps. I do it every summer because it's fun. The week before tryouts, I took it a little bit easier so that I could be ready. I didn't want to go all out and be sore for the first day of tryouts, because that's never good. I also went to all the open gyms.\n\nTPV: \u201cDid you expect to make varsity?\u201d\n\nAC: Not at all. The head coach Jekara Wilson invited me to varsity tryouts and that's as far as I expected to go, because it is an accomplishment to even get invited because only six freshmen were. I was so happy because it's just amazing.\n\nTPV: You said you were excited to make varsity, could you elaborate on how you felt when you were told that you were going to be on varsity volleyball?\n\nAC: So my dad came downstairs and she [Wilson]&nbsp;&nbsp;sent out an email, he came downstairs and said \u201cBad news Ash\u201d and I was like \u201cOh that\u2019s okay, next year, I guess\u201d and he said \u201cNo, look you made it\u201d and I was like \u201cWhat!\u201d.\n\nTPV: How much more competitive is varsity volleyball compared to your club [Red Rock Volleyball Club]?\n\nAC: It\u2019s similar but different at the same time. Red Rock is all about power and hard hits and digging everything and consistency, consistency. At Paly it's like they are all amazing players too, but it's more about strategy. It's different strategies. But the girls here are smarter, they are so good.\n\nTPV: Last year a current sophomore named Chelsea Fan made varsity as a freshman and the year before that Jessica Lee made varsity as a freshman, have you talked to them about tips and what it is like being a freshman. Do you feel like you have shoes to fill?\n\nAC: They are both amazing players. I haven\u2019t talked to them specifically, but I have talked to Claire Dennis who&nbsp;made it her freshman year, she has been really, really nice and supportive and really helpful to me. She congratulated me when I made the team. She texted me when we got the roster saying \u201cCongratulations, that's great. I was in your shoes a couple years ago and it was really tough but at the same time it was the best season I ever had and I hope you have the same experience I do,\" That was really nice that she would do that.\n\nTPV: What is the vibe on the team like?\n\nAC: It\u2019s really good. Coach Wilson really emphasized in tryouts that you need good chemistry as a team or else it doesn\u2019t go well, because you need communication. Volleyball is a team sport so all the girls have to be super supportive.&nbsp;Sometimes you need to yell at somebody for something they did wrong, but they do it nicely. It\u2019s good. We play well together.\n\nTPV: A lot of times freshmen don't get a lot of playing time on varsity teams. How do you feel about that? Was there ever a thought about not playing varsity and instead playing junior varsity so you could get more playing time?\n\nAC: Well I did the same thing for club. I played Red Rock and didn't get much playing time at all but you have to work for your playing time, no matter how good you are. Just by practicing with the girls, I have developed so much, that it is worth it for me to stay even if I don\u2019t play that much. It's worth it. I think we play five sets and some teams in our league aren't as good so hopefully I get to play.","excerpt":"This week, The Paly Voice sat down with Freshman volleyball player Ashlyn Callan, to discuss how she made varsity, upperclassmen, and her love for volleyball.

Photo by Adrienne Kwok.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe application deadline for Advanced Authentic Research, a program that will allow Palo Alto Unified School District high school students to showcase their applied research skills in a variety of academic subjects, is approaching on Sept. 25.\r\n\r\nAccording to AAR Coordinator Jeong Choe, students will be responsible for creating a specific thesis and researching their own\u00a0topics. Students can conduct \u00a0research on a multitude of themes, including history, psychology, business and sports.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe program is a unique opportunity for students in grades 10-12,\u201d Choe said. \u201cIt is designed for students with interest, passion, curiosity and perseverance to investigate an authentic topic of their choosing.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn addition, students will be paired with a mentor knowledgeable in the chosen area of research, according to Choe.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey [Mentors] will support and facilitate each student\u2019s work in their own laboratories, offices and other settings,\u201d Choe said. \u201cIf students are conducting surveys, they may be at another place. If students are doing computational work, the place may be flexible.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis year, students will participate in the program on their own time after school or during the weekend this year, but starting next year the program will be incorporated into a 7th Period class, according to PAUSD\u00a0Deputy Supt.\u00a0Markus Autrey.\r\n\r\nStudents will receive 10 Career Technical Education school credits for completing the program and working for a minimum of 60 hours per semester, though the scheduling is flexible. The class is pass or fail, according to Choe, and progress report will be collected from participants\u00a0in February.\r\n\r\n\u201cSome students may choose to spend more time than this based on their development of interests and passion in their research project,\u201d Choe said.\r\n\r\nWhile the program is similar to Paly\u2019s Science Research Project program, AAR is not limited to science-related topics.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou can view AAR as an expansion of SRP,\u201d Choe said. \u201cSRP has a science focus and a lab component is a crucial piece. In AAR, we are giving opportunities to all the other disciplines.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Choe, students will begin researching their topics in October and finalize their findings in May.\r\n\r\nBoth Paly and Gunn High School are providing the program for its inaugural year.\r\n\r\nGunn High School AAR liaison Angela Merchant says\u00a0AAR is an excellent program for students.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are looking forward to organizing and implementing this great opportunity for kids,\u201d Merchant said.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.pausd.org\/sites\/default\/files\/pdf-faqs\/attachments\/ApplicationAAR-Fillable.pdf\">Applications<\/a> are due through an email to Choe at jchoe@pausd.org.

The game will kick off at 7:30 p.m. on Friday, Sept. 25.\r\n\r\nLast Friday, the Vikings were able to keep up with the Monarchs for nearly three quarters, tying the game at 28 apiece on a connection between senior quarterback Justin Hull and senior wide receiver Riley Schoeben midway through the third quarter. The Monarchs, who came into the game ranked 54th in California, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.maxpreps.com\/high-schools\/archbishop-mitty-monarchs-(san-jose,ca)\/football\/home.htm\">MaxPreps.com<\/a>, closed the game with 24 unanswered points, slamming the door on any hopes of an upset by the Vikings.\r\n\r\nSenior captain and wide receiver Eli Givens is optimistic that the return of a number of injured players this week will provide a boost on the defensive side.\r\n\r\n\"We just need our injured players that didn't play last week to step up and help us out on defense,\" Givens said.\r\n\r\nThe Eagles, led by junior quarterback Tyler McGovern and senior running back Rasaan Fontenette, had a bye week this past week after being shut out by Valley Christian High School (3-0, 0-0) 24-0 on Sept. 11. Despite noticeable offensive struggles from the team, Fontenette has averaged 182 rushing yards per game through two games this season, according to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.maxpreps.com\/high-schools\/oak-grove-eagles-(san-jose,ca)\/football\/stats.htm\">MaxPreps.com<\/a>.\r\n\r\nGivens stressed that executing on both sides of the ball will be key for the Vikings.\r\n\r\n\"I think we will be able to pass and get some good run plays against Oak Grove and if our defense plays to its full potential then we will take care of them,\" Givens said.\r\n\r\nThe matchup will be the final game of the Vikings' non-conference schedule, as the team will begin De Anza League play a week later on Oct. 2 against Saratoga High School (1-2, 0-0). Saratoga eliminated the Vikings from Central Coast Section playoff contention on the final day of the regular season last November.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School football team (1-2, 0-0) is looking to move past last week's 52-28 loss to the Archbishop Mitty Monarchs (3-0, 0-0) and secure a victory at home over the winless Oak Grove Eagles (0-2, 0-0), a matchup that kicks off at 7:30 p.m. this Friday, Sept. 25.
