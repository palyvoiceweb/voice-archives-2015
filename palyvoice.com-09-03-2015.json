Lab events involve \u00a0understanding whatever material is encompassed in the guidelines, but also being familiar with lab procedures.\u00a0Engineering events are events in which we build certain devices or objects, according to the rules of each event, that must accomplish a certain task on the day of the competition.\"\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\nThe team has been practicing since October, according to Lu.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe hold weekly meetings at one of our houses for the entire team so that we can study and prepare together,\u201d Lu said. \u201cMost of our preparation occurs outside of school, except for a few lab events. We're getting into the final stages of preparation.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe team has historically done well at regionals.\r\n\r\n\u201cPaly actually has two teams: Green Team and White Team,\u201d Lu said. \u201cGreen Team is generally the more competitive of the two and for the last several years has taken first in the region and first or second at States.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis year, the team hopes to qualify for Nationals.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe're hoping to not only maintain our performance in Regionals, but also perform better at the Norcal State competition, where we placed <a href=\"adam.stern*acterra.org\t\u2022%20Executive Director\t650-962-9876 x303 Alex Von Feldt alexv*acterra.org\t\u2022 Stewardship Program Director\t650-962-9876 x315 Amber De Buizer amberd*acterra.org\t\u2022 Development Director\t650-962-9876 x308 Ariane Erickson acterrabea*gmail.com\t\u2022 Business Environmental Awards Program Director\t650-561-4711 Avi Starr-Glass avi.starrglass*acterra.org\t\u2022 Stewardship Project Manager\t  Claire Elliott clairee*acterra.org\t\u2022 Stewardship Program Senior Ecologist\t650-962-9876 x311 Deanna Giuliano nursery*acterra.org\t\u2022 Native Plant Nursery Manager and Botanical Consultant\t650-949-3158 Erin Banks Rusby erin.rusby*acterra.org\t\u2022 Stewardship Program Restoration Specialist\t  Jade Burr jade.burr*acterra.org\t\u2022 Watershed Steward Project Member\t  Jeremy Merckling jeremy.merckling*acterra.org\t\u2022 Watershed Steward Project Member\t  Jessica Sanchez jessica.sanchez*acterra.org\t\u2022 Stewardship Program Project Manager\t650-962-9876 x305 Joanne McFarlin joannem*acterra.org\t\u2022 Stewardship Program Senior Ecologist\t  Judi Eichler judie*acterra.org\t\u2022 Communications and Creative Director\t  Junko Bryant junkob*acterra.org\t\u2022 Stewardship Program Watershed Program Manager\t650-962-9876 x347 Kristen Williams kristen.williams*acterra.org\t\u2022 Stewardship Program Restoration Specialist\t  Lucia Moser lucia.moser*acterra.org\t\u2022 Development Coordinator\t650-962-9876 x346 Michael Viramontes michael.viramontes*acterra.org\t\u2022 Stewardship Program Restoration Specialist\t  Missy Pinney missyp*acterra.org\t\u2022 Stewardship Program Project Director\t  Pat Martin patm*acterra.org\t\u2022 Information Services and Technical Support Specialist \u2014 Environmental Library\t650-962-9876 x306 Paul Heiple paulh*acterra.org\t\u2022 Stewardship Program Staff Botanist\t650-854-7125 Peter Neal nursery*acterra.org\t\u2022 Stewardship Program Nursery Associate\t650-949-3158 Sara Witt saraw*acterra.org\t\u2022 Stewardship Program Project Director\t650-962-9876 x354 Talia Kirschner taliak*acterra.org\t\u2022 Stewardship Program Project Director\t650-962-9876 x310 Vida Rohani vidar*acterra.org\t\u2022 Business Manager\t650-962-9876 x307 Zach Miller zach.miller*acterra.org\">second last year<\/a>,\u201d Lu said. \u201cIn 2013, we placed <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2013\/02\/25\/science-olympiad-team-to-compete-in-states\/\">first over Mira Loma<\/a> by one point at the State competition and became the first team from the Bay Area to qualify to Nationals, so we're hoping to do that again.\u201d\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"Palo Alto High School\u2019s Science Olympiad team will be competing at the regional Science Olympiad competition on March 14 at San Jose City College.","date":"2015-03-07 18:17:18","author":"Will Zhou","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/11015708_10205025921064956_871277614_o.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":{"9689":"#norcal","39735":"alex lu","8944":"palo alto high school","14166":"paly scioly","39734":"regional","9074":"science olympiad","10045":"scioly"}},{"id":100168,"title":"Students to perform in state-wide musical","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/03\/07\/students-to-perform-in-state-wide-musical\/","content":"Six Palo Alto High School students are set to perform in a state-wide production of \"Hello!

The students had to prepare a song and read scenes for the audition, Leinhos says. Twenty students in total from various parts of California were selected for the production, which is a part of the 2015 California State Thespian Festival.\r\n\r\nThe musical, set in New York City during the 1910s, follows two young couples involved in the developing pop music industry, according to Rohrbach. The show features music composed by George Gershwin, Irving Berlin and Jerome Kern.\r\n\r\n\"It [the plot] is an interesting web that gets spun,\u201d Rohrbach said.\r\n\r\nThe student\u00a0performers\u00a0must travel to Los Angeles to rehearse for three weekends in total. According to sophomore Jason Pollak, the rehearsals last about 14 hours each day. While a production would typically be rehearsed in two- to three-hour intervals, the producers of this show have condensed the rehearsal time because so much travel is required to rehearse.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe show is turning out pretty well so far, although a lot of work has been squeezed into maybe five\u00a0total days of rehearsal since the beginning of the project,\u201d Leinhos said.\r\n\r\nAccording to Pollak, the cast has one more rehearsal before performing and is now focused on making sure the show runs smoothly.\r\n\r\nRohrbach encourages anyone who will be in the Southern California area to come watch the play.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019ll turn out really well,\" Rohrbach said. \"It\u2019ll be well worth it in the end.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe show was created and written by Cheri Steinkellner, a Tony-nominated and Emmy-winning playwright who also wrote the popular musical \"Sister\u00a0Act.\"\r\n\r\nLeinhos says she wanted to be a part of the show because of Steinkellner's mindset.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe [Steinkellner] wants our generation to learn and enjoy the songs that gave kids hope and joy so long ago, and I think with us bringing the show to State Festival, we're on our way to helping achieve that goal for her,\u201d Leinhos said.\r\n\r\nCalifornia Thespians, a chapter of the Educational Theatre Association, is sponsoring the production, according to Rohrbach.","excerpt":"Six Palo Alto High School students are set to perform in a state-wide production of \"Hello!

The social media site with over 1.39 billion users introduced this new feature on Feb. 25 to\u00a0offer\u00a0support to\u00a0individuals dealing with depression. Screenshot by Alex Merkle-Raymond.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nIn this article, we discuss both the pros and cons of such a feature.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n\r\n<em>Student opinion:\u00a0<\/em>I think it's a good thing, because there are a lot of people who post statuses that\u00a0I don't feel comfortable commenting on, but I can tell something is going on,\" senior Jack Brook said. \"It's good that you can do this anonymously without feeling awkward.\"\r\n\r\n<strong>1. It's anonymous<\/strong>.\u00a0Many\u00a0Facebook users have hundreds of\u00a0Facebook friends, many of whom may simply be acquaintances.\u00a0However, the anonymity of this\u00a0notification allows all Facebook friends to reach out to those who may be in pain, regardless\u00a0of how close the two individuals are to one another.\r\n\r\n<strong>2.\u00a0<\/strong><strong>There are options.<\/strong>\u00a0The new service not only attempts to help the potentially suicidal individual, but it also offers help to the user who reports the post, because, according to Facebook, \"it's important for you to feel supported, too.\" Due to this belief,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0presents the user with the ability to reach out to a friend, chat with a trained helper or\u00a0even\u00a0find nearby counseling services.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. It shows you care.<\/strong>\u00a0It is initially a Facebook friend who voices a sign of concern to the potentially suicidal individual. When the suicidal person receives a Facebook notification stating that someone believes they are in distress, the notification has the ability to make\u00a0the\u00a0suicidal person feel loved and cared for.\r\n\r\n<strong>4. Difficult situations are placed in the hands of professionals.<\/strong>\u00a0Often, many friends and family members are simply not equipped to handle a suicidal situation and they may become overwhelmed. The tools Facebook provide, however, aim to direct suicidal individuals to trained resources and facilities that know how to properly handle such a situation.\r\n\r\n<strong>5. Better safe than sorry.\u00a0<\/strong>Is there really any harm in\u00a0reaching out\u00a0to someone who is potentially upset? Often people just want to know that they are not alone and\u00a0that they\u00a0have support. This notification service assists\u00a0in doing so.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n\r\n<em>Student opinion<\/em>: \"It's a terrible thing,\" sophomore Johnny Rohrbach said. \"It's a complete invasion of privacy. I think you should be able to express yourself freely without people recommending a psychiatrist to you. If you want help, you should be able to seek it out yourself.\"\r\n\r\n<strong>1. It can be abused.<\/strong> Just like any other feature on Facebook,\u00a0this feature could\u00a0easily be used as a joke. Any status could theoretically be\u00a0reviewed, soon turning\u00a0this feature as a new way to \"poke\" friends.\u00a0The service could be overwhelmed with\u00a0false\u00a0requests, making it easy for researchers to\u00a0overlook any real inquiries.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. It's an invasion of privacy.\u00a0<\/strong>Many see\u00a0Facebook as a personal space for\u00a0sharing\u00a0posts, photos and information to friends. Giving users\u00a0the ability to report a post, even if it is to be reviewed by professionals, is an invasion of privacy for those who want to keep their posts within their friend group. On top of this,\u00a0a professional who\u00a0knows nothing about the potentially suicidal individual shouldn't be allowed to deem a Facebook post suicidal if that person\u00a0has absolutely\u00a0no background on the individual.\r\n\r\n<b>3. It's limited.<\/b> This feature only works for people who post\u00a0<em>statuses.<\/em>\u00a0If someone posts a picture or shares a wall post, this same feature would\u00a0not be available.\r\n\r\n<strong>4. It is difficult to access.\u00a0<\/strong>To initially report a status, one must click on \"I don't like this post,\" then \"I think it shouldn't be on Facebook,\" then \"I think they might hurt themselves,\" and finally \"It's hurtful, threatening or suicidal.\" It takes many clicks to report such a post and it can often be difficult to decide which of the multiple choice options is most suitable for the post. The complexity of the reporting process may deter users from reporting potentially harmful posts.\r\n\r\n<b>5. It\u00a0can make people feel uncomfortable.<\/b>\u00a0Because some people utilize\u00a0Facebook as a public journal\u00a0or blog, there may be Facebook statuses with emotional\u00a0content.\u00a0Thus, some Facebook users may report these posts\u00a0as\u00a0a cry for help.

With six departing seniors highlighted by pitcher Julia Saul and second baseman Hannah Bundy, second-year manager Bill Laskey, former San Francisco Giants, Montreal Expos and Cleveland Indians pitcher, will need this year's five seniors to step up to the plate in their absence.\r\n\r\nLike in previous years, this year's team captains consist of the seniors: first baseman\/outfielder Autumn Macareno, outfielder Julianna Heron, outfielder Maddy Jones, outfielder\/designated hitter Kabria Dame and pitcher\/infielder Casey Glassford.\r\n\r\n\"The goal of the team this season is to improve on what we did last year,\" assistant coach Mike Dutto said. \"We want to be better than just a little over .500 [record].\"\r\n\r\nDuring team tryouts, coaches made the decision to cut three senior players, one of whom was playing for the team last season. Dutto explained the move as a tough but necessary decision.\r\n\r\n\"We would like to keep everyone, but we can't if [the players] are just going to sit on the bench the whole time,\" Dutto said. \"We have a new program here, and we are developing our younger players, who need to play.\"\r\n\r\nSophomore third basemen Maggie Renteria praised Laskey's motivating influence.\r\n\r\n\"I like how he really pushes us to work hard,\" Renteria said. \"He is really motivating and focused on helping us. I think his number one priority is for everyone to be the best they can be and always play one hundred percent as a team.\"\r\n\r\nJunior second basemen Jesse Kim agreed with Renteria, emphasizing Laskey's dedication to his players.\r\n\r\n\"I like how he seems to be very dedicated and intent on improving everyone,\" Kim said.\r\n\r\nThe girls' first league game is at 4 p.m. on Wednesday, March 18 at Monta Vista High School.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School softball team (1-1, 0-0) is striving to improve drastically after last year's mediocre season, inspired by a manager stressing the importance of working hard.","date":"2015-03-04 17:47:40","author":"Josh Yuen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/11039358_10202463600030274_542839_n.jpg","categories":["Sports","Spotlight"],"tags":{"40096":"bill laskey","40095":"girls softball","40098":"jesse kim","40099":"maggie renteria","11391":"new season","8944":"palo alto high school","12045":"season preview","18372":"softball"}}]
