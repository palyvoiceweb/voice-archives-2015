She teaches both English 10\/10A and American Literature for juniors. According to Williamson she would love to teach an elective in upcoming years. Along with teaching English, Williamson is the assistant coach for Paly\u2019s dance team and even helped lead the teacher dance during Spirit Week.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m an assistant coach,\" Williamson said. \"It\u2019s fun. She [dance teacher Hillary McDaniels] organized and I helped. We co-choreographed. I loved Spirit Week.\u201d\r\n\r\nWilliamson grew up near Palo Alto in Sunnyvale and graduated from Fremont High School. During her high school career, she\u00a0participated in theater and was the president of the spoken word poetry club at her school. After graduation, she attended De Anza College for three years before transferring to University of California, Los Angeles. Williamson was always passionate about English and knew that\u00a0if her theatrical dreams did not work out she would like to pursue a career in English education.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was thinking about pursuing theatre and Broadway and when that didn't pan out, I had to refocus,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cAnd I really loved talking about education with people. A lot of my friends had a lot of problems in the way the education system is [run] so I want to help fix that.\u201d\r\n\r\nHaving graduated from school relatively recently, Williamson says she is able to relate to her students and the problems they face each day.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that there still needs to be that student-teacher line,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cBut I do want you guys to know that it really wasn't that long ago that I went through all the same stuff that you're going through now and that I can talk to you guys and support you through everything.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Williamson, Paly itself is not the place to blame for student stress, but rather the Palo Alto student environment as a whole.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI think that there's so much that the teachers do all the time with the way that they conduct their classes and the different things being set into place at Paly that are there to really support students,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cI think it has to do more with the community we\u2019re in, and the environment and the fact that [Stanford] is across the street staring at us every day and just kind of looming.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nThe biggest advice that Williamson has for students about stress or feeling down is to not be ashamed to talk to someone about it.\r\n\r\n\u201cTalk to somebody,\" Williamson said. \"Don\u2019t feel ashamed because it's such a human experience. Everyone\u2019s going through it. It's just because we live in silence all the time so people feel like you should feel bad about it. You really don't have to feel bad about it. And you\u2019ll get better.\u201d\r\n\r\nHaving gone through the college application process herself recently, Williamson believes that sometimes going to community college and transferring to another school can be a good option.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t ruin your life trying to stress out about it now and feel sad if you can\u2019t make it for some reason that\u2019s completely out of your control when you can instead plan your future in a different way,\" Williamson said. \"That would be more beneficial for you.\"\r\n\r\nWilliamson loves teaching at Paly and thinks of it as a unique\u00a0opportunity that she plans to continue career for as long as possible.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt's a pretty cross your heart thing getting placed somewhere like Paly, so as long as they want me, I\u2019ll stay,\u201d Williamson said.<\/span>","excerpt":"The Paly Voice sat down with english teacher Alanna Williamson over an iced eggnog latte to discuss how the new school year is going and her best advice for students.\r\n","date":"2015-11-15 22:15:08","author":"Morgan Keller","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/alannawilliamson.jpg","categories":["Coffee chats","Entertainment","Uncategorized"],"tags":["coffee","coffee chat","english","ms. williamson","Teacher","williamson"]},{"id":112026,"title":"Annual Turkey Trot Feast is on Friday, Nov. 20","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/11\/14\/annual-turkey-trot-feast-is-on-friday-nov-20\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2015-11-14 23:20:32","author":"Josh Yuen","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]},{"id":112024,"title":"Advisory this week is for all freshmen and juniors","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/11\/14\/advisory-this-week-is-for-all-freshmen-and-juniors\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2015-11-14 23:17:12","author":"Josh Yuen","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]},{"id":111956,"title":"Boys&#8217; water polo team to kick off CCS playoffs against Saint Francis","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/11\/13\/boys-water-polo-team-to-kick-off-ccs-playoffs-against-saint-francis\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_111983\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"631\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/BoysWaterPolo2.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-111983\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/BoysWaterPolo2.jpg\" alt=\"Senior Cameron Khan attempts to make a pass during a game against Gunn earlier this season.

Junior Jared Stanley attributed the loss to a sluggish start and emphasized the importance of having the right mindset going into the game.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have played them before but we didn't come\u00a0out firing in the first couple of minutes,\u201d Stanley said. \u201cWe really need to come out hard in the first minutes of this game in order to set the tone.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Stanley, going into the quarterfinal game, the Vikings have the right mentality needed to win.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe had a really good focused practice today, so I believe we are more than capable of coming out with a win against Saint Francis,\u201d Stanley said. \u201cWe know our match ups and it's going to be a great game.\u201d\r\n\r\nJunior Andrew Jozefov says that the team has specifically been working on the team\u2019s defense during practice this week in order to prepare for Saint Francis.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo prepare ourselves for this game, we have been working on sharpening our one-on-one drive defense because that was our biggest weakness last time we lost to them this season,\u201d Jozefov said. \u201cThis time we know that our drive defense, our press and our crash on set will be better and sharper because we know that they [Saint Francis] had trouble against it last time.\u201d\r\n\r\nJozefov also highlighted Bellarmine, a team they have not played this season and Gunn, a team they split their series with this season, as teams that will be tough in their CCS playoff bracket.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe tough teams this year in CCS are Bellarmine and Gunn,\" Jozefov said. \"To beat Gunn all we need to do is have the same focused mentality and drive to win. In order to beat Bellarmine, we will need to play some great counter-defense and really communicate to each other on defense to stop their quick and effective counter.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Vikings are optimistic that they will reach the CCS finals, a season-long goal.\r\n\r\n\"We are very excited going into CCS because this is what the whole season has led to,\" senior Winston Rosati said. \"We want to win and I think if all the parts come together it is possible.

Despite these injuries, many of our underclassmen have stepped up, improving tremendously throughout the season.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In spite of these setbacks, several runners are expected to stand out.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sophomore Julia Doubson had an amazing season,\u201d senior team captain Portia Barrientos said. \u201cShe improved by about a minute on the Crystal Springs course which is really impressive.

While the bread was a bit hard, the sandwich had fresh ingredients and the avocado was appetizing. Both the turkey and cheese were flavorful, although the condiments were bland. The sandwich's overall taste was stronger than most other sandwiches, and the bread was surprisingly delicious.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The \u201cMargherita Pizza\u201d ($13.95), another customer favorite, is composed of a light San Marzano tomato sauce, fior di latte mozzarella, fresh basil, sea salt, with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil. The pizza is split into eight slices, a bit too much for a single person serving. As I took a bite of the pizza sprinkled with basil leaves I noticed that the thin crust was crunchy and there was a strong tomato sauce flavor.

Photo by MGM\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" \/><\/a> James Bond has returned within the new film, \"Spectre.\" Overall the film is satisfactory, but plot details take away from the action scenes and the story itself. Photo by MGM.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe James Bond franchise has returned with the thrilling new chapter to the Bond series, \"Spectre.\" The film continues the traditions from previous eras and as well as the story from recent Bond films while paving its own path, differentiating it from other Bond films. Its exciting sequences, iconic references and humorous script is sure to please both casual and die-hard Bond fans alike.\r\n\r\n\"Spectre,\" directed by Sam Mendes, begins with an opening sequence in Mexico City that rivals some of the best opening sequences in the series. The sequence follows Bond (Daniel Craig) tracking down a mysterious villain through the town square during the festive Day of the Dead celebrations. Bond then engages in a brilliantly shot helicopter fight scene which caps the action-packed opening scene. The rest of the movie follows Bond\u2019s quest to track down a person from his past and to take down the terrorist organization, Spectre.\r\n\r\nOne way \"Spectre\" succeeds is that it incorporates all the classic Bond moments that old fans will love. The introduction of \"Bond, James Bond?\" Check. Shaken, not stirred? Yup. The timeless Aston Martin? Of course. There are even many references to past films (\"From Russia With Love\" train scene, anyone?). However, where this film differs from the majority of the series is in its exploration of Bond\u2019s (Daniel Craig) past, a continuing theme from all of Craig\u2019s past Bond films.\r\n\r\nThough the exploration of Bond\u2019s past was done very well in Craig's previous movies (namely \"Casino Royale\" and \"Skyfall\"), in \"Spectre\" it distracts rather than adds to the plot. Extended monologues takes away from the action scenes and slows the pace of the movie. Also, the focus on Bond\u2019s past does not accentuate Bond\u2019s traditional mysterious and stoic nature and makes him much softer than previous films. It also leads to an unorthodox ending that combined with rumors of \"Spectre\" being Craig\u2019s final Bond film, fuels many rumors regarding the plot of the next film, \"Bond 25.\"\r\n\r\nDespite those issues, \"Spectre\" succeeds in many ways. Supporting characters Eve Moneypenny (Naomie Harris), Q (Ben Whishaw) and M (Ralph Fiennes) continue their strong performances from \"Skyfall.\" Harris plays a great sidekick to Bond while Whishaw does a phenomenal job adding funny moments and continuing to play an exceptional younger Q. Fiennes also does a good job taking over from the longtime Judie Dench as M, incorporating the steely attitude needed for the character. The script is well done, incorporating humor throughout while still retaining the darker feel regarding Bond's past. The cinematography is shot very well, as the action scenes were captivating and intense. The different locations Bond ventures into, such as Mexico City and Rome, are captured well by the directing, the clothing is classy and fashionable, and the explosions are bigger than ever.\r\n\r\nChristoph Waltz (Ernst Blofeld) plays a phenomenal antagonist. Waltz\u2019s idiosyncratic acting fits seamlessly with the role of \u201cOberhauser,\u201d but there is one problem \u2013 there was not enough of him. The first half of the film foreshadows Oberhauser to be an extremely powerful and invincible villain. However, when he is on-screen, he gives too many monologues and isn\u2019t able to have the same impact as past villains such as Raoul Silva (Javier Bardem) from \"Skyfall.\"\r\n\r\nDespite the divergence from the traditional Bond script, \"Spectre\" still retains the traditional Bond moments die-hard fans will look for, and its enthralling action scenes and humorous moments make it a must-watch even for the casual moviegoer.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"The James Bond franchise has returned with another hit film, \"Spectre.\" The film follows  Bond's attempt to track down a foe from his past and take down a terrorist organization.

In the game show, audience members\u00a0make deals with the show's host.\u00a0The host offers contestants something of value, such as cash, and contestants must choose whether to keep the object or trade it for a mystery item.\r\n\r\n\u201cMost of my friends and family were pretty shocked when they found out I was on the show, mostly because I hadn't mentioned it before,\u201d Mackris said. \u201cThe show taped in June, but I wasn't allowed to tell anyone that I was a contestant until the show aired.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the show, Mackris avoided purchasing a zonk; an object with little value to the buyer. She later turned down another unknown item, revealed to be a trip to the Caribbean island St. Lucia.\r\n\r\n\u201cI actually don't regret missing out on the trip to St. Lucia,\u201d Mackris said. \u201cIt would have been a cool experience but if I had won the trip I still probably would have traded it for the big deal of the day at the end of the show and would have ended up with the motorcycle anyway.\u201d\r\n\r\nFinally, she purchased a game room which she later traded for a \u201cbig deal\u201d mystery item. While Mackris won a motorcycle and avoided the meager prize of $2,160, she lost out on a Chevy Sonic Sedan worth $25,879.\r\n\r\nMackris plans on selling the motorcycle.\r\n\r\n\u201cThose who know me know that I'm the farthest thing from a \u2018biker chick,\u2019 so I got a lot of people asking me if I was actually going to ride it or not,\u201d she said.\r\n\r\nDespite not receiving the grand prize, Mackris says she enjoyed the experience.\r\n\r\n\u201cI would absolutely love to be on 'Let's Make A Deal' again, even if I was just in the audience,\u201d Mackris said. \u201cThe energy in the studio that day was unlike anything I had experienced before and by the time we left that day we all felt like one big family.\u201d","excerpt":"A Palo Alto High School alumna won a new motorcycle on the CBS channel game show \u201cLet\u2019s Make a Deal\u201d that aired last Wednesday.","date":"2015-11-11 16:27:15","author":"Adrienne Kwok","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/12195773_935542996529214_7788620552987236578_n.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["alum","game show","lets make a deal","molly mackris","motorcycle","palo alto high school","paly","rhubarb","st lucia","television","tv"]}]
