The minutes will be a short summary of what the club did at the meeting and of the number of the people in the club. The minutes will also have to be signed off by the club adviser.\r\n\r\nAccording to Nagar, ASB implemented the new policy in an attempt to improve Paly clubs.\r\n\r\nThe policy is reformed \"so that ASB can help clubs more effectively and reduce inactive clubs,\u201d Nagar said.\r\n\r\n\u201c[The purpose of this policy] is just so that we can monitor what clubs are doing and how ASB can best help their needs,\u201d Nagar said.\r\n\r\nThe policy will come into effect after Club Day on Sept. 21.\r\n\r\nKey Club has been following the new requirements since its creation, according to Marc Tolentino, Key Club adviser and English teacher\r\n\r\n\u201cThe minutes themselves are something that show that the clubs are using their time wisely,\u201d Tolentino said.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School Associated Student Body approved a major change to club policy today, August 24, in hopes of reducing inactivity amongst Paly clubs as Club Day approaches.","date":"2015-08-24 19:06:39","author":"Mary McNamara","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/key-club.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"47586":"anmol","40634":"anmol nagar","8496":"ASB","11711":"club day","11337":"clubs","43597":"key club","47587":"nagar","8939":"palo alto","8953":"paly","9169":"tolentino"}},{"id":105938,"title":"Theater welcomes all to audition for fall plays, &#8220;Shrek&#8221; and &#8220;The Odyssey&#8221;","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/08\/24\/theater-welcomes-all-to-audition-for-fall-plays-shrek-and-the-odyssey\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_105940\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"619\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/shrekandodyssey.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-105940\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/shrekandodyssey.jpg\" alt=\"The Palo Alto Theatre Department audition sign-ups are available in the Haymarket.

According to Herr, there are many available roles and auditioning actors don\u2019t have to be experienced actors.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe would like to encourage people outside of the theater department to come and see what it\u2019s like to be a part of it,\u201d Herr said.\r\n\r\nHerr and Kienitz, who both have experience producing children\u2019s shows, chose the play \u201cShrek the Musical Jr.\u201d because they wished for a show that would appeal to a broad audience.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou pick up a show that the high school kids would want to see as well as younger people,\u201d Kienitz said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tricky thing to do, to find a show that\u2019s known by high school people, adults, and to the younger kids. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do, we\u2019re going to expand it as far as we can and draw in as many audience members as we can.\u201d\r\n\r\n\"The Odyssey,\" however, was chosen after discovering a flaw with the show the department had originally chosen, according to Woods.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was a whole other interesting journey because originally we were planning on doing \u2018Metamorphoses,\u2019 which is a retelling of Greek Myths,\u201d Woods said. \u201cBut you need a swimming pool. We realized that we\u2019re in the middle of a drought and that it was probably not the best choice.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Woods, those with musical talent who are not necessarily actors can also audition for \u201cThe Odyssey.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have a Paly graduate, Jonathan Shue, who\u2019s a professional actor and musician, and he\u2019s going to be working with students to compose music as a part of \u2018The Odyssey,\u2019\u201d Woods said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of innovation around the staging piece and the music.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe directors are not the only ones excited about the upcoming fall plays. According to junior Molly Kraus, who will be auditioning for \u201cThe Odyssey,\u201d she is most excited for the people.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s always the people we\u2019re really here for in the end,\u201d Kraus said. \u201cEveryone involved in the production, whether they\u2019re on stage, behind it or watching it.\u201d\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School Theater Department is hosting auditions for its fall plays \"Shrek\" and \"The Odyssey\" at 3 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. Tuesday and Wednesday with callbacks on Thursday at the Haymarket Theatre.","date":"2015-08-24 12:03:28","author":"Ana Caklovic","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/shrekandodyssey.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"47574":"auditions","47570":"august","47569":"fall play","47573":"greek mythology","29689":"kathleen woods","13035":"molly kraus","47566":"Shrek the Musical jr","47572":"tanna herr","47567":"the odyssey","9159":"theater","47568":"theatre auditions","47571":"tony kienitz"}},{"id":105975,"title":"First Friday Lunch Rally: A spirited start to the new year","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/08\/23\/first-friday-lunch-rally-a-spirited-start-to-the-new-year\/","content":"To kick off the new school year, the Palo Alto High School Associated Student Body organized\u00a0a <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/08\/20\/first-rally-of-the-year-to-feature-performances-and-relay-race\/\">lunchtime rally on Friday<\/a>, complete with a relay race and performance.\r\n\r\nJunior ASB Spirit\u00a0Commissioner Cezanne Lane was delighted with the outcome of the rally.\r\n\r\n\u201cEveryone seemed really excited about it,\u201d Lane said. \u201cI kind of think of this rally as a hint to the freshmen, like \u2018Hey, we are super into our spirit and we want you to be too!\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Paly Dance Team performed a dance choreographed by senior captains Melanie Guan and Emma Sternfield.

She then curiously proceeded to pass out a bunch of half-sheets of paper to our class. She told us to read what the piece of paper said and follow the instructions on it. Simple enough, right? So once she passed me mine, I read it and, at the top, it said: \u201cPeople with high self-confidence are more susceptible to flattery than those with low self-confidence.\u201d Makes sense! Then I read the question on the paper: did I agree or disagree with the finding? I agreed. Now the paper asked: please explain why this finding is true. I had no trouble stating that \u201cobviously, people with high self-confidence must have cultivated this attitude by buying in to the flattery they\u2019ve received.\u201d And that was it. I looked up at Ms. Mattes to show that I was done, and soon my whole class did the same.\r\n\r\nMs. Mattes then asked us: \u201chow many of you agree with this finding?\u201d and we <em>all<\/em> raised our hands. \u201cHow many of you had no trouble explaining this finding?\u201d she asked. Again, we <em>all <\/em>raised our hands. But here comes the twist. Ms. Mattes asked someone from the other side of the classroom to read their half-sheet out loud: (listen carefully) \u201cPeople with <em>low<\/em> self-confidence are more susceptible to flattery than those with high self-confidence.\u201d Everyone on my side of the class suddenly groaned. Did <em>you<\/em> catch it? To the other half of the class, Ms. Mattes passed out the <em>exact opposite <\/em>finding, yet we were all <em>equally<\/em> able to agree with and support our own findings. Each one of us in the classroom believed that our own explanations represented simple common sense.\r\n\r\nSo don\u2019t get me wrong, I love Ms. Mattes, but she <em>duped<\/em> us, and she did so with a phenomenon called hindsight bias. According to our beloved AP Psychology textbook, hindsight bias is defined as \u201cthe tendency to believe after learning an outcome that one would\u2019ve foreseen it.\u201d You might have also heard of it as the \u201cI-knew-it-all-along effect\u201d or, simply, \u201chindsight is 20\/20.\u201d Introduced to us as a danger when analyzing experimental studies, hindsight bias can actually be found everywhere around us.\r\n\r\nIn interpreting history \u2014 how often have we heard that a victory in a certain battle or election was \u201cinevitable\u201d? In sports \u2014 how many times have you heard the announcer declare how obvious it was that the team would win...but only <em>after<\/em> they had won? Even in relationships -- \u201cOh yeah, I <em>knew<\/em> they would break up.\u201d But most pertinent to us all today is in the way we look at our times at Paly. All of us, at some point, have thought along the lines of \u201cOh, Of course, I didn\u2019t get into that school because I didn\u2019t have this or that on my resume.\u201d \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have done that activity, I obviously wouldn\u2019t have liked it and I shouldn\u2019t have wasted my time.\u201d Taking a step back, it\u2019s easy to see why these thoughts represent hindsight bias. Did you <em>really<\/em> know such things all along? Probably not. Looking back into the past, we see our lives as easily predictable. Unfortunately, thinking this way encourages the notion that each decision we make has a sense of cold, deterministic certainty.\r\n\r\nIn the same vein, as we all move on to our bright futures, let\u2019s not allow this natural human tendency of hindsight bias to morph into a sort of foresight bias \u2014 we shouldn\u2019t be tempted to feel that our future lives can be predicted. Rather, we should <em>dare<\/em> to take a step that leads us down an unpredictable path. We should <em>dare<\/em> to venture boldly into the unknown and have the <em>audacity<\/em> to act with the knowledge that there is no certain path from the present... to the future.\r\n\r\nFour years ago, at my eighth grade graduation, I confidently stated exactly what defined \u201csuccess\u201d and the way each one of us would achieve it in high school. I talked about how \u201csuccess is found in how we stick to our beliefs.\u201d I threw out even more cliches. I even used some vague quote about success from a man I didn\u2019t know one thing about. One of my great heroes, Mr. Bungarden, would probably have something to say about this. Mr. Bungarden recently told me that \u201cnothing is scarier than an 18-year-old who has \u2018figured out\u2019 life.\u201d And at that moment as a <em>14-year-old <\/em>atop the podium at the end of 8th grade, I certainly thought that I had figured out life. But now I\u2019m a little wiser than I was then, and Mr. Bungarden, you were right. Five, fifteen, or fifty years in the future, let\u2019s look back without hindsight bias, without believing that our lives were predictable. We all have some of the most exciting years and exciting choices of our life to come. Our futures have nothing determined about them. PALY Class of 2015, it\u2019s time to embrace this uncertainty without hindsight bias, without foresight bias, but with every sense of bold possibility. Thank you very much everybody!","excerpt":"The Paly Voice acquired the Graduation speech of senior Alex Hwang, with his consent to publish.","date":"2015-06-09 18:02:16","author":"Adele Bloch","categories":["Uncategorized"],"tags":[]},{"id":105672,"title":"\u201cThe Cosmos and Us\u201d by Emma Chiu","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/06\/09\/the-cosmos-and-us-by-emma-chiu\/","content":"<em>The Paly Voice\u00a0acquired the following Graduation speech from its author,\u00a0with the authors consent to publish.

They include storming the basketball court when the varsity boys beat Gunn on our senior night, and also taking one too many selfies with James Franco. Even though so many of my memories of Paly are overwhelmingly positive, there were also some moments I wish I could forget but just can\u2019t. One that will never leave my memory was the morning when I came to school and a Caltrain sat motionless on the tracks.\r\n\r\nLater that same day, my English teacher showed our class an article titled \"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2008\/11\/02\/education\/edlife\/quoted.html?_r=0\">The Cosmos and You<\/a>,\u201d about a young woman at Dartmouth College who asks her Astronomy professor, \u201cHow do you keep from despairing at the immensity of space and the smallness of us?\u201d A shortened version of his reply goes as follows:\r\n\r\n\u201cJohanna, you are most certainly an infinitesimal in the cold, vastness of the cosmos, and your life is barely a mathematical\u00a0instant in the span of time. But you are also, just as certainly, a miracle: you are a creature capable of thought, of wonder, of awe. You are capable of love, and so need not despair of insignificance. Having said that see you Monday.\u201d\r\n\r\nNow, this response resonated with me so strongly that day, because I think at Paly many of us, including myself, have at some point questioned our self-worth or significance. You don\u2019t need to have studied Astronomy for that thought to come across your mind. But because all of us are here today, each and every one of us had someone in this community who reminded us of our potential and of our importance.\r\n\r\nIn my mind, what defines the Paly experience is going through the highest of highs and lowest of lows, but when confronting those lows, there is always someone who is more than willing to be there for you. Because of what we\u2019ve gone through and how countless other people have been that support for us when we needed it most, I think our class is especially aware of the significance and magnitude that a touch of kindness can have on another person.\r\n\r\nKnowing this, we stand poised and ready to be that potential rock for someone we may barely know. We are prepared to be that light, as others had done for us, when we ourselves slipped into darkness.\r\n\r\nIt is this compassion from others that has allowed us to be here today. It is this compassion that made it so we can truly enjoy those flashbulb moments. And it is this compassion that let us become aware of our significance. I am forever grateful for these people who have allowed me to feel their love, where I feel most alive and most significant. They are the moments where the words of the Dartmouth Astronomy professor ring most true: that we are capable of thought, of wonder, and of awe, and that we are, just as certainly, a miracle.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"The Paly Voice acquired the Graduation speech of senior Emma Chiu, with her consent to publish.","date":"2015-06-09 18:02:10","author":"Adele Bloch","categories":["Uncategorized"],"tags":[]}]
