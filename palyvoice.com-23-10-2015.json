They are a good example of what we are going to want to have in the future.\u201d\r\n\r\nDespite having five different scorers on the scoresheet, the Vikings were unable to take down Monta Vista. Senior co-captain Kevin Bowers was disappointed with the loss and attributed it to a deviation from the game plan.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe didn't play our game,\" Bowers said. \"We usually play a defensive game and try to keep the score low. But this game was a shootout, and Monta Vista can shoot the ball pretty well, so they managed to put us away.\u201d\r\n\r\nDespite playing competitively in the second and third quarters, the Vikings suffered a faulty opening and fourth quarter, when they were outscored by a combined score of five to one. Johnson thought that the slow start was detrimental to the Vikings' chances.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe really didn\u2019t come out firing in this game,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe played down to our opponent\u2019s level instead of making them play up to ours.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Jozefov, despite the loss, the Vikings' season remains in their hands and getting first place in their league is not impossible. Rosati also echoed these sentiments.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was a tough loss, but the season\u2019s not over,\u201d Senior co-captain Winston Rosati said. \u201cNow we just have to recover from this game.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Vikings' next game is at 6:45 p.m. next Tuesday, Oct. 27, at Los Altos High School.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School boys' water polo team fell to Monta Vista High School on Senior Night at Gunn High School.
