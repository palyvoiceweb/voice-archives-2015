The debaters received professional coaching and have been practicing for weeks to perfect their cases, according to Savage.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, freshman Tanay Krishna won the novice division of the Western Novice National Championships, continuing Paly\u2019s history of victory at the tournament.\r\n\r\nAccording to Savage, success at the tournament last weekend was due to the hard work of the debaters and coaching staff, the help of varsity debaters for additional coaching and the supportive nature of the team. The performance of the debaters was impressive due to the level of competition at the tournament, Savage said.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Western States Novice and JV Championship drew the top beginning and intermediate debaters from the Western Region of the US, so competition was extremely fierce,\u201d Savage said. \u00a0\u201cIn addition, the tournament was twice the size it has been in years past, so it was much more difficult to reach elimination rounds.\u201d\r\n\r\nAlthough the team is highly accomplished, Savage is proud of her team's progress\u00a0in and out of competition.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe often say that our team is 49% about speech and debate and 51% about life,\u201d Savage said. \u201cWe are exceptionally successful in competition, but our greatest strength and achievement is how bonded we are as a team and how we pull together as a family.\u201d\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School Speech and Debate team is continuing an impressive season after winning the Western Novice National Championships for the third consecutive year.

SciOly\u00a0competitions are similar to golf in that teams try\u00a0to get as low a score as possible. Winning all 23 events would give a team 23 points in total, which is the lowest possible score.\r\n\r\n\u201cOur success this year is primarily due to an accumulation of experience in engineering events, where we've stumbled in the past,\u201d Lu said. \u201cIn addition, this is the first year that we've had such a high number of upperclassmen on the team. ... Their\u00a0experience and dedication is definitely something that has impacted the performance of the team.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Lu, Paly had ten first-place finishes and averaged between second and third for the other events.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis year was our best overall performance but not really our biggest landslide victory,\u201d Lu said.\r\n\r\nLast year, the <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/03\/27\/science-olympiad-wins-regional-competition-heads-to-states\/\" target=\"_blank\">team won Regionals<\/a> but <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/04\/17\/science-olympiad-places-second-at-state-competition\/\" target=\"_blank\">came in second<\/a> at States to rival Mira Loma High School.

According to the App\u00a0Store, \u201c7 Cups of Tea\u201d strives to create a supportive and anonymous community where people feel safe to share and vent.\r\n\r\nAccording to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.7cupsoftea.com\/\">7 Cups of Tea website<\/a>, the app \u201canonymously and securely connects\u201d the user to a trained and active volunteer listener. The volunteers are trained in an Active Listening Course. According to the website, many listeners are licensed professional counselors and therapists but do not give medical advice during conversations. Instead they will refer the person they are listening to a local therapist, counselor or emergency contact. After signing in, members can scroll down a\u00a0list of \u201clisteners,\" each with a personal profile and rating so they can choose the listener best suited for their needs.\r\n\r\nAnother great aspect\u00a0about the app is its open forum, with topics ranging from inspirational quotes to relationship advice.

Senior Captain Joesph Chang said he gives Halas his full support.\r\n\r\n\u201cI have confidence in Coach Halas,\" Chang said. \"I know he can bring the best out of each of us.\"\r\n\r\nHalas said the team is still learning\u00a0as its early in the season, the team is still learning how to work with each other.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are still a lot of unknowns, but our goal is to find a way to work together,\u201d Halas said.\r\n\r\nAccording to Chang, despite losing key seniors last year the team has found a balance between new players and veterans.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have some very talented young players such as Jacqueline Cai and Emily Yu as well as good support and leadership from established veterans such as Eric Chiang and Promise Lee,\u201d Chang said.\r\n\r\nThis year the team\u2019s goal is to stay in the upper league of De Anza, according to junior Josh Ng.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings will take on Monta Vista High School on March 25 at home in their first match.","excerpt":"Despite technical confusions with coaching staff and finding room to practice, the Palo Alto High School Badminton team is aiming high with hopes to win De Anza league.","date":"2015-03-17 01:02:59","author":"Mary McNamara","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/palyvoicebadminton1.jpg","categories":["Sports"],"tags":{"15905":"badminton","8634":"de anza league","40605":"Justin Halas","10750":"palo alto high school boys soccer","8953":"paly"}}]
