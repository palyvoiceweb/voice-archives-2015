Last year, the team exited the playoffs one stage earlier.\r\n\r\nJunior Jared Stanley said he thought that the team could have done better in the CCS playoffs.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe past season went very well, but we were hoping to get a little bit further in CCS,\u201d Stanley said. \u201cIt was disappointing to lose in the quarterfinals of CCS. It was also disappointing to not perform as we had expected to in the league tournament as we were hoping to play in the league final.\u201d\r\n\r\nJunior Andrew Jozefov said that a lack of focus from the team ultimately led to its loss.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe had a few dedicated guys who performed well this year,\u201d Jozefov said. \u201cWe didn't necessarily have everyone on the team working with the same mentality, which didn't exactly help the team.\u201d\r\n\r\nJozefov said that the Vikings will have high goals going into next season.\r\n\r\n\u201cNext year we plan on winning leagues and beating Gunn [High School] in league play,\u201d Jozefov said. \u201cHopefully we can earn a good seed for CCS and get a bye into the semis so we have a solid chance at making some good things happen against some of the top private schools.\u201d\r\n\r\nDespite losing eight seniors including Kevin Bowers, Justyn Cheung, Christian Laurence, Ryan Reed, Luke Coleman, Cameron Kahn and Winston Rosati, the Vikings are very optimistic for the future and believe they will have the experience necessary to do well in the CCS playoffs next year. According to Stanley, the team will have a majority of senior starters as there are many current juniors who can step up. However, even though the team will have enough experience, Stanley recognized the importance of the team's mentality.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe will have almost a full senior starting lineup next year and as a result hope to definitely be serious contenders for CCS finals,\" Stanley said. \"In order to do so we need to practice hard in the off season and treat every game like it's our last.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School boys' water polo team (12-13, 8-6) looks toward a fresh start next year after a disappointing end to its season.","date":"2015-11-30 20:50:12","author":"Chirag Akella","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/WaterPoloPractice.jpg","categories":["Sports","Spotlight","water polo"],"tags":["boys water polo","CCS","jozefov","stanley","vikings","water polo"]},{"id":112531,"title":"ASB Movie Night &#8220;Home Alone&#8221; is this Friday, Dec. 4 in the Media Arts Center","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/11\/30\/asb-movie-night-home-alone-is-this-friday-dec-4-in-the-media-arts-center\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2015-11-30 15:47:10","author":"Josh Yuen","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]},{"id":112529,"title":"ASB Kickball Game is this Friday, Dec. 4 during lunch","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/11\/30\/asb-kickball-game-is-this-friday-dec-4-during-lunch\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2015-11-30 15:45:39","author":"Josh Yuen","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]},{"id":112526,"title":"Choir Madrigal Feaste begins on Dec. 4 and runs through Dec. 6 at Jordan Middle School","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/11\/30\/choir-madrigal-feaste-begins-this-friday-dec-4-and-runs-through-sunday-dec-6-at-jordan-middle-school\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2015-11-30 15:42:08","author":"Josh Yuen","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]},{"id":112522,"title":"Fiery arts winter sale is this Friday, Dec. 4 and Saturday, Dec. 5, outside the tower building","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/11\/30\/fiery-arts-winter-sale-is-this-friday-dec-4-and-saturday-dec-5-outside-the-tower-building\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2015-11-30 15:35:25","author":"Josh Yuen","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]},{"id":112500,"title":"Advisory this week is for all sophomores and freshmen (individual meetings)","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/11\/30\/advisory-this-week-is-for-all-sophomores-and-freshmen-individual-meetings\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2015-11-30 11:53:50","author":"Josh Yuen","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]},{"id":112354,"title":"Season Preview: Girls&#8217; soccer hopes to continue success","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/11\/30\/season-preview-girls-soccer-hopes-to-continue-success\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_112355\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/MG_3002.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-112355\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/MG_3002.jpg\" alt=\"Senior Jacey Pederson dribbles the ball past a defender as the Vikings defeat Menlo Atherton 1-0 in the CCS quarterfinals last season.

We also have three or four players just a bit under her skill-wise.\u201d\r\n\r\nSenior defender Jacey Pederson shares many of the same sentiments as her coach.\r\n\r\n\u201cEvery year we've gotten further and further in CCS,\u201d Pederson said. \u201cLosing last year's championship was disappointing, but this year it's only motivating us to work even harder, and hopefully this year we can win it all.\u201d\r\n\r\nSome players to look out for are seniors Pederson, Heidi Moeser and sophomore Emily Tomz according to Pederson.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings' first game is at 3:15 p.m., Dec. 3\u00a0at Los Altos High School.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School girls' soccer team looks to bounce back this year after a disappointing loss to Mountain View High School in the Central Coast Section finals last year.\r\n","date":"2015-11-30 11:52:25","author":"Ethan Kao","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/MG_3002.jpg","categories":["Sports","Uncategorized"],"tags":["CCS","girls","girls soccer","Soccer"]},{"id":112429,"title":"Boys&#8217; cross country to compete at state championships","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/11\/27\/boys-cross-country-to-compete-at-state-championships\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_112451\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"604\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/Screen-Shot-2015-11-27-at-6.38.22-PM.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-112451\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/Screen-Shot-2015-11-27-at-6.38.22-PM.png\" alt=\"Juniors Kent Slaney and Naveen pai run at the Sunnyvale baylands earlier this season.

Famous monuments such as the Sydney Opera House, the statue of Christ the Redeemer and the World Trade Center lit up the colors of the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tricolore<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Snapchat offered a temporary filter with the text \u201cPray for Paris,\u201d and Facebook gave its users the option to superimpose the French flag on their profile pictures.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The day after the attacks, I checked my Facebook feed and encountered a sea of red, white and blue; my Facebook friends had changed their profile pictures in an attempt to express their support for the nation of France. Feeling moved by this display of solidarity, I quickly decided to take up Facebook\u2019s offer and change my profile picture too.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, in the very moment I clicked post, a question occurred to me: Was there any value in what I just did?<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I tried to process the rationale\u00a0behind\u00a0my decision. Did I change my profile picture to raise awareness? Absolutely not. You\u2019d have to be living under a rock to not know this tragedy occurred. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Did I do it to console people in a time of grief? Well, if that was my objective, I wasn't sure if\u00a0seeing the French flag overlaid over Facebook profile pictures was of genuine solace to people intimately connected with France. To get\u00a0more\u00a0insight, I spoke with junior Emily Read, who lived in a small town outside of Paris for several years. She changed her Facebook profile picture to the \"Peace for Paris\" Eiffel Tower graphic that was widely popularized on social media in the aftermath of the tragedy.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cSeeing people\u2019s profile pictures and buildings across the world light up red, white and blue is nice because it\u2019s really uniting,\u201d Read said. \u201cWe can\u2019t really do anything actively about the attacks, but we can at least show our support.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Read did note that she was personally disappointed by the fact that Facebook had made it an option to overlay only the French flag, when there had been so many attacks in other parts of the world. However, she criticized some for perpetuating the notion that the attention directed toward the tragedy in France was excessive.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI did not like that some people negated the support toward Paris and said \u2018Why are we supporting Paris so much? We should be supporting the other places instead,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be neglecting our support toward Paris; we should be supporting everyone at the same time.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, perhaps the thorniest issue surrounding the social media movement is that these gestures are inherently Eurocentric. We had the option to display our support for France, but not for Lebanon, nor Syria nor any other nation that experienced tremendous tragedies that same day. Have people, perhaps inadvertently, espoused Western-centrism by making this display of solidarity?<\/span>\r\n\r\nEven if the gesture does come across as Western-centric, all the blame cannot be placed squarely on the individuals who adopted it. The reason that so many Americans sprung to change their profile pictures to the flag of France and not that of other nations is the result of years and years of close cultural ties with Europe, in tandem with minimal\u00a0media coverage in non-Western nations. I\u2019m not suggesting that we should shirk our obligations to be informed about world affairs\u00a0\u2014 rather, I\u2019m simply saying that this kind of social media mobilization in response to a tragedy in a\u00a0western European nation should not have been unexpected.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, I don\u2019t think that the outpouring of support\u00a0on social media in this manner was inherently ill-intentioned. It may come across as perfunctory and not all that useful \u2014 how is superimposing the French flag over our faces supposed to solve anything? \u2014 but there is, oddly enough, an element of pragmatism in such a gesture. It stems from the realization that we don\u2019t have the capability to solve the insidious problem at hand, but we can show our solidarity. And of course, social media is one of the most accessible platforms to display\u00a0that sentiment.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The French flag stunt\u00a0is simply the most recent manifestation of a\u00a0wide-spread cultural phenomenon \u2014 taking to social media to express support for causes that are morally resonant\u00a0but perhaps feel remote and intangible. We should be careful to avoid thinking that social media activity is the sole way we can\u00a0make a difference. I know that none of us are going to single-handedly stamp out terrorism, but we do have a role to play. We can, for example, combat the rampant Islamophobia and xenophobia\u00a0that is unfounded\u00a0and causes extremist organizations\u00a0to fester, while still\u00a0engaging in\u00a0meaningful dialogue about eradicating\u00a0terrorism. Furthermore, we can take it upon ourselves to become more informed citizens (perhaps all that entails is parsing over the World News section for a little bit longer).<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At some point,\u00a0the last traces of red, white and blue will disappear from our newsfeeds,\u00a0perhaps to be replaced by another social media crusade. There is some value to be found in such a\u00a0display, but it's\u00a0important that we are not deluded into thinking symbolism is\u00a0the only means by which we can effect change.\u00a0<\/span>","excerpt":"Social media gestures in the wake of tragedy may come across as perfunctory and not all that useful, but they, oddly enough, are rooted in pragmatism.
