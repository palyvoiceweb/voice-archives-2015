Although Paly's Model United Nations club has been around for four\u00a0years, quite a few Paly students are unaware of what the club is actually about. Senior club President Zofia Ahmad and junior Vice President Eli Craverio Frankel explain what goes on in MUN club.\r\n\r\n\u201cPaly Model United Nations is a club intended for students to learn about world politics and events, teach members how to debate and write position papers and attend Model United Nations conferences around the Bay,\u201d Frankel said.\r\n\r\nAt these conferences, each high school is assigned a country and assigned a committee with a specific topic. Then they must research the country and its position, write the position paper and go to the conferences to debate and find a solution.\r\n\r\n\u201cOnce we find our solution we have to work together with the other countries to write and pass a resolution,\u201d Frankel said. \u201cIt is a really fun and interesting experience.\u201d\r\n\r\nFrankel said that some topics that the club has seen this year were Israel vs Palestine, cyber warfare, maritime piracy, and the Syrian Civil War.\r\n\r\nAccording to Frankel, so far this year Model UN has attended the Intergenerational Model United Nations Conference in San Francisco, Stanford Model United Nations Conference, Santa Clara Valley Model United Nations Conference at Santa Teresa High School in San Jos\u00e9, and Berkeley Model United Nations Conference at UC Berkeley.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe conferences we attend, especially Berkeley Model UN Conference and Stanford Model UN Conference, are attended by people from all over the world, and as you can imagine, a bunch of really put-together people in suits can be really intimidating,\u201d Ahmad said. \u201cA big part of being successful at conferences is being confident in your solutions and research, even if you're completely making something up.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Ahmad, in order to give the club the opportunity to get comfortable debating and discussing within parliamentary procedure, the leadership team implemented mock conferences for club members.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis year I think the biggest change we implemented was hosting mock conferences,\u201d Ahmad said. \u201cWe decided to do these so that our members would be more prepared for actual conferences and the style of debating you do there.\u201d\r\n\r\nMany members of the club won awards at these conferences for excellent research and in-committee skills, including junior Chris van Gelder (3 times), sophomore Gaby Pelayo, sophomore Joelle Dong, sophomore Zahra Muzaffar, and more, according to Frankel.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis year has been an amazing year for the club as we have grown significantly to include more members,\u201d Frankel said. In addition, we have improved how the clubs works and learns thanks to our amazing president Zofia Ahmad, our wonderful secretary sophomore Mary McNamara, our terrific treasurer Alicia Mies, and our two awesome advisors, history teachers Mr. Grant Blackburn and Mr. Christopher Farina.\u201d\r\n\r\nPaly MUN meets every Monday in room 813 during lunch.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe hope to continue improving our club next year and create more amazing MUN experiences,\u201d Frankel said.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"Although Palo Alto High School's Model United Nations club has been around for four years, quite a few Paly students are unaware of what the club is actually about.

According to Lacob, after years of failing to reach his goals, he developed a relentless attitude that has led his team in a position to win its first NBA championship since 1975. Photo by George Lu.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nResiliancy has become a defining trait for Golden State Warriors majority owner Joe Lacob. This was apparent in Lacob's talk Tuesday afternoon in the Palo Alto High School Media Arts Center as he\u00a0shared stories\u00a0about his successes as a National Basketball Association owner and\u00a0the challenges he faced along the way and how he overcame them.\r\n\r\nBefore a crowd of 100 Paly students and staff, Lacob discussed his past failures, which included getting placed on the wait list for Stanford University, not getting accepted into University of California\u00a0at\u00a0Los Angeles School of Medicine and losing out on the potential success of the American Basketball League due to\u00a0the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.wnba.com\">Women's National Basketball Association<\/a>\u00a0gaining a national television contract and pushing out the former. According to Lacob, despite these setbacks, he\u00a0has no regrets and is only looking forward.\r\n\r\nSince acquiring ownership of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nba.com\/warriors\/playoffs\/2015\/tickets#\/\">Golden State Warriors<\/a>\u00a0NBA team on July 15, 2010, a dream of Lacob's since he was 10 years old, he said he\u00a0has boosted the overall quality of the team, finishing with an impressive 67-15 record during this year's regular season, despite initially firing almost all of the management staff that were in employment\u00a0at the time he acquired the team. His tenure has included the firing and hiring of four different coaches within a five-year span, most controversially last summer by replacing\u00a0Mark Jackson with current head coach Steve Kerr.\r\n\r\nEx-coach Jackson helped the Warriors go from 23 wins during his first season to 51 wins by his third, contributing to the successful redesign of the Warriors franchise according to Lacob during his talk. However, Lacob saw this vast improvement as <a href=\"http:\/\/www.mercurynews.com\/warriors\/ci_27078013\/warriors-co-owner-lacob-lists-reasons-firing-mark\">not good enough<\/a>, and he wanted nothing but the best.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is controversy about Lacob's decision to fire Jackson, who led the Warriors to the Western Conference semi-finals in 2013 and the 50-win plateau the following year, Lacob boldly believed at the time that the Warriors could do even better, a point he emphasized in particular during his talk with students.\r\n\r\n\"<span style=\"color: #373e4d;\">We want great people in every position down the board,\" Lacob said. \"We want only the best guys for this team.\" Lacob added\u00a0on that even though Kerr was a rookie head coach, he has always believed that this industry was meant for the youth.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\nSince his hiring, Kerr has managed 67 wins as a rookie coach and only two losses at home with the Warriors, making them one of the\u00a0favorites to win the NBA championship this year, according to Las Vegas <a href=\"http:\/\/espn.go.com\/chalk\/story\/_\/id\/12336767\/golden-state-warriors-cleveland-cavaliers-favored-las-vegas-win-nba-championship\">odds<\/a>.\r\n\r\nLacob also spoke about the importance of setting high and audacious goals, shown through his cunning purchase of the Warriors, trading star player Monta Ellis to the Milwaukee Bucks in 2012 in exchange for the then-injured center Andrew Bogut and with the firing of a successful coaching staff in 2014. Although these are examples of making risky choices, they have panned out to be successful, according to Lacob.\r\n\r\nIn response to the criticism he received, Lacob advised students to follow their instincts.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #373e4d;\">\"Everybody has an opinion,\" Lacob said. \"Do what your gut tells you to do.\"\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\nEmphasizing the key concept of relentlessness, Lacob stressed that it\u00a0is a crucial value that has contributed to his overall success.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #373e4d;\">\"I relentlessly pursued excellence and was successful in the end.\" \u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"The Golden State Warriors, the Bay Area's NBA lottery-team turned championship-contender has come a long way in a span of five years.
