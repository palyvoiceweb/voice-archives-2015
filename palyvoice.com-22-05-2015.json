One hundred percent of the profit will be going to ACS, according to Chevallier. They were inspired to support ACS after\u00a0the string of student deaths in the fall and winter.\r\n\r\n\"So many people go to counseling, more than you would think,\" Chevallier said. \"They directly work with the teens to make them feel better, which I think is\u00a0honestly the best way to help make this place a better community. They give love to students that don't have it.\"\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_104760\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"363\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/IMG_7447.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-104760\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/05\/IMG_7447.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_7447\" width=\"363\" height=\"273\" \/><\/a> One of the creators of the bracelets, senior Claire Chevallier models one of the wrap-styles.

Chevallier's <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/claire.chevallier.10\/posts\/942516742436627?pnref=story%20\">Facebook post<\/a> states that \"your purchase can help ensure that ACS will continue making differences in Paly students' lives.\"\r\n\r\n\"It took a lot of perseverance to get here,\" Chevallier said. \"At one point, I was thinking of canceling the whole project, but because I persevered, I was able to make it happen and I'm really glad that I did.\"\r\n\r\nBracelets are wrap-style beaded which are hand made by Chevallier and Chiu.
