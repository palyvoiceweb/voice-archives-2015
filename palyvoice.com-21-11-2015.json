Photo courtesy of storycorps.com[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Palo Alto High School library is encouraging participation in \"The Great Thanksgiving Listen\", a story sharing project held created by <a href=\"https:\/\/storycorps.me\/about\/the-great-thanksgiving-listen\/\">Storycorps<\/a>.The Great Thanksgiving Listen takes place online through Nov. 28, the end of Thanksgiving weekend. Storycorps is a non-profit organization dedicated to oral-based story telling. Those who participate in Storycorps record their life experiences that are then\u00a0transformed\u00a0into animations. It's Storycorps' goal to create videos that reflect the powerful, individual experiences of Americans across the country.\r\n\r\nThe Great Thanksgiving Listen gives\u00a0students a chance to interview an \u201celder\u201d and capture his or her life stories, according to librarian Rachel Kellerman. Afterwards, students are given the option to upload the finished animated videos to the United States Library of Congress.\r\n\r\nKellerman says she finds value in helping students participate in the nationwide project.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are such a diverse and interesting country and I have such a limited experience in this world that when I hear other people\u2019s stories it helps me to feel connected to my fellow citizens,\u201d Kellerman said. \u201cI also learn a lot about compassion and courage from listening to how people struggle and embrace life\u2019s challenges.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Kellerman, during the event, students are free to book an online time to record a story of the person they choose to listen to. StoryCorps has an app that is designed to help students create questions, take pictures with the storyteller and upload the clip. In order to download the app, students must have parent permission, according to Kellerman.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Storycorps interview process only takes a couple of hours, and it can be very uplifting and memorable,\u201d Kellerman said.\r\n\r\nThe Paly library is providing more information for students who are interested in Storycorps. To get help in participating, see Kellerman in the Paly library on Friday or check her updates on Schoology.","excerpt":"The library is encouraging participation in The Great Thanksgiving Listen, a story sharing project by a non-profit organization called Storycorps.","date":"2015-11-19 21:06:08","author":"Morgan Keller","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/TGL-Horizontal-w-background.png","categories":["News"],"tags":["Library","paly","storycorp","storytelling","the great thanksgiving listen"]},{"id":112188,"title":"Football faces Salinas in CCS Playoffs","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/11\/19\/football-faces-salinas-in-ccs-playoffs\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_111207\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/I9P8242.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-111207\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/I9P8242.jpg\" alt=\"ehauifheia\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" \/><\/a> Sophomore running back Paul Jackson III drives downfield in the Vikings' last home game of the season against the Homestead Mustangs.

When I first heard the term \u201ccultural appropriation\u201d without fully understanding the definition, I reflected back on my own life and anxiously wondered if these events had been innocuous exposures to different cultures or if I had been unknowingly appropriating cultures since my elementary school years. In reality, I had simply celebrated these festivities alongside my friends.\u00a0It's appropriate\u00a0to experience other\u00a0cultures, as long as individuals maintain and recognize the\u00a0meaning\u00a0to ethnic and racial groups.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently at Yale University, the <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/11\/09\/nyregion\/yale-culturally-insensitive-halloween-costumes-free-speech.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intercultural Affairs Council reminded students<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to stay sensitive of other cultures when choosing Halloween costumes in preparation for the holiday. Erika Christakis, a residential college associate master, ignited an uproar when she <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/pastebin.com\/egSQGfgK\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">replied to this reminder<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> asking, \u201cIs there no room anymore for a child or young person to be a little bit obnoxious \u2026 a little bit inappropriate or provocative or, yes, offensive?\u201d She elaborated on her own experience, saying, \u201cWhen I lived in Bangladesh, I bought a sari because it was beautiful, even though I looked stupid in it and never wore it once. Am I fetishizing and appropriating others\u2019 cultural experiences? Probably. But I really, really like them too.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Christakis demonstrated exactly what Yale\u2019s Intercultural Affairs Council wanted to avoid. Although\u00a0she recognizes\u00a0her insensitivity in the email, her tone indicates little remorse because she focused on the aesthetic appeal of the sari without regard to its practical or symbolic value to the Bangladeshi. Her remarks\u00a0veered into the dangerous and offensive area of appropriation.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The immediate student body reaction to Christaki's email was visceral, and many demanded her\u00a0resignation. While onlookers may view this as an overreaction, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@aaronzlewis\/what-s-really-going-on-at-yale-6bdbbeeb57a6\">Yale student Aaron Lewis wrote<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0that trivial Halloween costumes were not the basis of the students\u2019 protests, but rather the prolonged failure of Yale administration to combat racism on campus. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without a doubt, the issue of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/11\/12\/us\/racial-discrimination-protests-ignite-at-colleges-across-the-us.html\">racial discrimination is and has been prevalent at many universities<\/a>\u00a0throughout the United States, notably including the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/11\/12\/us\/university-of-missouri-protests.html?_r=0\">University of Missouri<\/a>,\u00a0where there were race-inspired death threats.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0Clearly, it is unacceptable for students and faculty to perpetuate others\u2019 discomfort through racist remarks or actions. Despite disagreeing with Christakis\u2019s overarching message, her email made me think about the expansive gray area between inappropriate exploitations of other cultures and the opportunity to explore various cultures to expand one's own\u00a0perspective.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of my first introductions to the term \u201ccultural appropriation\u201d was through actress Amandla Stenberg, who created a\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=O1KJRRSB_XA\">video to\u00a0promote awareness of the issue<\/a>\u00a0in African-American culture.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0Stenberg addresses the exploitation of cornrows, a practical hairstyle for African-Americans that has become\u00a0a fundamental component of their identity. As hip-hop, another part of African-American culture, became increasingly popular, many African-Americans' cultural markers\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">became adopted by a wider, predominantly white, society. Soon, celebrities and models of Caucasian descent sported the hairstyle, and transitively, African-American culture became a trend, one that\u00a0exists even at our own school. Before\u00a0Spirit Week during the theme selection process, many students viewed a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/09\/04\/ban-on-junior-spirit-week-theme-idea-causes-uproar\/\">nominated Spirit Week theme of \u201cGold Chains<\/a>\"<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0as marginalizing a minority.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But should Eminem and Iggy Azalea not rap simply because they aren't African-American? If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, why is there such a loud uproar in defiance of these actions?<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The broader issue is not necessarily that people are experimenting with different cultures, but rather that gestures can often be interpreted as an ignorance of\u00a0the symbolic significance to a distinct group of people.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The United States is supposed to be a cultural melting pot; sharing ways of life\u00a0is an integral foundation of American culture itself. Jazz music, considered a classic American music genre, epitomizes the consolidation of many cultures. It originated in\u00a0New Orleans and has roots from all over the world, ranging from French and Italian opera to Caribbean and Mexican music. If this form of cultural diffusion had been mislabeled as cultural appropriation at that time, it could have hindered the\u00a0growth of\u00a0this treasured part of American culture. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, it is inappropriate to stereotype and trivialize ways of life. Furthermore, it is unacceptable to claim ownership over another culture's aspects. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However,\u00a0upon understanding the backstories, it should be\u00a0acceptable to celebrate alongside others. S<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">haring cultures is essential to expanding an individual\u2019s perspectives.

According to Palo Alto High School psychologist Jonathan Frecceri, Paly students will be able to see many of the campaigns put into action on campus this month. Photo by Vivian Wu.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nSources of Strength, an initiative at Palo Alto and Gunn high schools, is organizing student-run campaigns in order for staff, students and parents to spread ideas of hope, health and strength.\r\n\r\nThe program is in its inaugural year at both Paly\u00a0and Gunn and its objective is to spread stories of resilience and the overcoming of struggles, rather than sharing those of pain or trauma, according to Paly school psychologist Jonathan Frecceri. One major goal of the initiative is to replace any negative culture, such as bullying, suicide and substance abuse with the development of a more positive culture.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t talk about sadness, shock or trauma messaging, but rather hope, health and strength messaging,\u201d Frecceri said. \u201cWe can start to change the way that we talk about past failure and the way we talk about disappointment and struggle, to talking about how we bounced back.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to the <a href=\"https:\/\/sourcesofstrength.org\/discover\/history\/\" target=\"_blank\">Source of Strength website<\/a>, the initiative has spread to become a nationwide movement across the United States since its founding in a Native American reservation system in North Dakota in 1988 as a suicide prevention program. Sources of Strength has reduced the number of suicide attempts in other communities similar to that of Palo Alto, according to Frecceri.\r\n\r\n\u201cSources of Strength has been implemented in communities like ours where we\u2019ve had suicide contagion, and it\u2019s been shown to build protective factors in those communities,\u201d Frecceri said. \u201cWe live in a community here in Palo Alto where there is a certain culture of achievement. Success kind of looks one way. We have to change that narrative somehow and I think Sources of Strength is a good way for us to start that. It\u2019s not about being silent but it is about sharing the hope, the health, and the strength that we\u2019ve learned and used to come through hard times.\u201d\r\n\r\nInitially, staff nominated approximately 150 students to be part of the initiative's core members, but the group is now comprised of 68 students, along with 25 mentors who are Paly staff members. Members underwent a training session in October to understand what it takes to be a peer leader and learn about the variety of sources of strength that people rely on.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe asked teachers and staff across campus to send us a list of nominations of students in ninth, 10th, 11th and 12th grade that they thought were students who in their various social groups had a voice,\u201d Frecceri said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t say to send us a list of leaders or to send us a list of those traditional high-achieving students or popular students.\u201d\r\n\r\nTogether, mentors will work with students on two overarching campaigns. While mentors facilitate progress and provide the students with materials, students are mostly in charge of conducting the project. One campaign seeks to\u00a0identify and thank trusted adults on campus while the other is centered on gratitude. Sources of Strength students are divided into eight different groups with approximately eight students and three mentors who will focus on more specific subsets of the two main campaigns.\r\n\r\nSome of the groups will specialize in campaigning through social media, audio-visual means, presentations or event coordinating, according to Frecceri. Students meet twice a month\u00a0with their groups to help brainstorm, plan, execute and reflect on their campaigns.\r\n\r\n\u201cI'm the adviser for the audio-visual committee,\" said Sharla May, math teacher and a Sources of Strength adviser. \"They're dealing with audio aspects of the campaign. Currently, the members are trying to publicize their campaign through InFocus, Paly Radio or even the MAC [Media Arts Center] screens.\u201d\r\n\r\nPaly students will witness many of these campaigns implemented on campus this month.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe groups have been meeting since Oct. 12,\u201d Frecceri said. \u201cNow they\u2019re in the phase of implementation and in the week following Thanksgiving, you\u2019ll see a lot of these campaigns getting rolled out.\u201d\r\n\r\nJunior Zahra Muzaffar, a member of Sources of Strength, is one of six students who, along with the guidance of two mentors, has developed and launched a campaign this Monday.

Franco recalls how music surrounded many of his school experiences.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne of my best friends was in a band called Smiley Face,\u201d Franco said. \"There were a lot of battles of the bands.\u201d\r\n\r\nOf the various bands that participated in battle of the bands, Franco recalls a female\u00a0band\u00a0to be his favorite.\r\n\r\n\u201cRaggedy Ann was the only female band,\u201d Franco said. \u201cThey were the biggest band to come out of all of them and they actually went on to become\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.the-donnas.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">The\u00a0Donnas<\/a>.\u201d\r\n\r\nFranco currently enjoys all types of music, but is\u00a0especially drawn to alternative music, much like his alternative work displayed in his art and short movies.\r\n\r\n\u201cI really enjoy listening to Motown, and I listen to a lot of Rolling Stones,\u201d Franco said. \u201cBut I have to admit, I currently really like all three of Justin Bieber\u2019s new singles.\u201d\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/embed.spotify.com\/?uri=spotify%3Auser%3Aethankao55%3Aplaylist%3A6tWPWBZi0IL7ojQF3KClZY\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>","excerpt":"The Paly Voice sat down with successful actor and Palo Alto High School graduate James Franco to discuss how music influenced his Paly experience and career.","date":"2015-11-17 20:53:31","author":"Ethan Kao","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/Screen-Shot-2015-11-17-at-8.54.26-PM.png","categories":["Tuesday Tunes"],"tags":["famous","film workshop","james","james franco","the interview","tuesday","Tuesday Tunes","tunes"]},{"id":112094,"title":"Album Review: Logic impresses in &#8220;The Incredible True Story&#8221;","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/11\/17\/album-review-logic-impresses-in-the-incredible-true-story\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_112097\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"800\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/1800x1800sr.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-112097\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/1800x1800sr.jpg\" alt=\"Logic's album cover for &quot;The Incredible True Story&quot;.

His debut album, \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/teamvisionary\/sets\/logic-under-pressure\">Under Pressure<\/a>\u201d,\u00a0which released last October, impressed listeners through the rapper's strong lyrics and messages. It was also met with positive reviews from various critics. Songs such as\u00a0\u201cGang Related\u201d and \u201cMetropolis\u201d shine among others, and give the audience a peek into his turbulent life. Logic has also released four mixtapes prior to signing with Def Jam Records, a giant in the industry that has signed prominent artists such as Rihanna and Kanye West. Logic released his highly anticipated second album \"The Incredible True Story\" on Nov. 13 after much anticipation, and he solidifies\u00a0his legitimacy in the industry.\r\n\r\nLogic, who grew up in an\u00a0indigent neighborhood in Maryland, details his rough childhood in his lyrics. He grew up with a distant relationship with both his Caucasian mother and African-American father, who both struggled with drug and alcohol addiction. He started skipping class in high school, leading him to expulsion during his sophomore year. Despite these hardships, Logic turned to music to express his struggles. Ever since, he has steadily gained attention from producers and musicians for his brilliant musical flow.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Incredible True Story\u201d is a powerful and consistently thematic album that demonstrates his lyrical genius. Like other rap albums, Logic interweaves a storyline into the album \u2013 in one night's worth of work \u2013 and finds inspiration from film director Quentin Tarantino's style of script writing. Based on a narrative 100 years in the future, Logic takes the listeners on a journey through space. The two main characters in the storyline of the album, Thomas and Kai, fly through galaxies to find a planet called \u201cParadise,\u201d mimicking a future uninhabitable Earth. The skits featuring the two characters\u2019 adventure and music combine to create a professionally developed sophomore album.\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bIInvYbY9XA\r\n\r\nAmong the 18 tracks on the album, a couple stood out in particular. Read below to get a taste of some of my favorites on \"The Incredible True Story.\"\r\n\r\nSong 2: \u201cFade Away\u201d\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/embed.spotify.com\/?uri=spotify%3Atrack%3A4QRWA5UqYU1st9aO0UfxOj\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\nImmediately, the beat gives us a positive and refreshing feel. Logic ties back to the first track \u201cContact\u201d by repeating in the chorus that his status won\u2019t disappear until his name fades away, which isn\u2019t any time soon. Logic voices his opinion on the lavish life he worked hard for, especially for someone who grew up in a dangerous and poor neighborhood. He maintains a euphonious flow while applying literary elements like homophones and integrating SAT-caliber vocabulary smoothly into rhymes that would impress even English Honors teachers. At the end of the song, Thomas and Kai talk to Thalia, the voice simulator in the ship.\r\nWhen Thomas informs Kai about Thalia\u2019s ability to gather information and simulate any person in history, Kai chooses rapper (and Logic\u2019s friend) Big Sean to talk to, and Sean makes a cameo, asking Kai what\u2019s up. This little segment\u2019s humor and lightheartedness weaves in nicely with the mood of the song, as well as setting up the next song, \u201cUpgrade.\u201d\r\n\r\nSong 3: \u201cUpgrade\u201d\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/embed.spotify.com\/?uri=spotify%3Atrack%3A5psz20rVFNRlt0u9cpzBpY\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\nOh. My. Goodness. Logic really packs heat in \u201cUpgrade\u201d; this is already my favorite song on the album. He somehow combines rapid-fire bars with a poised and mellow tone, a rare talent even in the upper echelons of the hip hop industry. Accelerating, singing, rapping \u2013 Logic is a triple threat in the studio. Logic throws in plenty of allusions to classic films and television, such as \u201cMartin,\u201d implying he sticks to his roots while upgrading to a higher level musically. Logic has definitely upgraded, and with his presence alone, he upgrades the entire rap game.\r\n\r\nSong 5: \u201cLike Woah\u201d\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/embed.spotify.com\/?uri=spotify%3Atrack%3A6bM3GKo47KVgvj3gHdWS0U\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\nThe title of this song perfectly reflects my reaction to this song. Logic is a storyteller, but after taking a moment to see where he is at in life now, he cannot express his reaction with any another word than \u201cwoah.\" He is taken aback by the lavish lifestyle he has obtained, in comparison to growing up on food stamps. The jazzy beat that vaguely reminds me of \u201cThe Girl from Ipanema,\u201d and similarly so, \u201cLike Woah\u201d is a dreamy and nostalgic song that takes listeners to their respective happy places. \u201cThe Incredible True Story\u201d is off to a good start, to say the least.\r\n\r\nSong 6: \u201cYoung Jesus\u201d feat. Big Lenbo\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/embed.spotify.com\/?uri=spotify%3Atrack%3A0KiKfllNTmhImvXVIHqR0z\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\nLogic, known for mixing old school music with contemporary sound, begins the song by saying \u201cTake \u2018em back to the '90s!\u201d and the beat has a clear Wu-Tang Clan feel to it. Logic\u2019s first verse is succinct, and then Big Lenbo \u2013 one of the original members of Logic\u2019s Rattpack group \u2013 comes in with heavy rapping that matches nicely with Logic\u2019s higher and quicker style. The duo continues to interchange with barely a beat in between, and the chemistry flows spectacularly between both rappers. The lyrics themselves are audacious as Logic and Big Lenbo express their lack of care for their critics and call out incapable MCs, which subtly matches with the the divine title of the song. This song's hypnotic beat and exciting lyrics had me nodding my head and grunting like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=lWLleo7NKh8\">Sway in the Morning<\/a>.\r\n\r\nSong 8: \u201cI am the Greatest\u201d\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/embed.spotify.com\/?uri=spotify%3Atrack%3A1BTj47Up5m8601KOFrTvkj\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\nBorrowing the great Muhammad Ali\u2019s words, Logic explains why he is the best in the game, all the while articulating his lack of love for other rappers. Logic boasts his musical skill and the messages he conveys, which include peace, love and positivity. As for other hip hop artists, Logic claims the vulgar images they tend to spread about women and money is harmful to society and the overall goodness of people. Even though I am a fan of <a href=\"http:\/\/runthetrap.com\/what-is-trap-music\/\">trap music<\/a> and stereotypical hip hop as well, Logic\u2019s words ring true, and the difference between his exceptional skill level and regular drill rap is obvious. Logic has a clear statement for the haters.\r\n\r\nSong 11: \u201cCity of Stars\u201d\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/embed.spotify.com\/?uri=spotify%3Atrack%3A5mJbSgVBnJ4ayOjFdmyOdl\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\nAlthough \u201cCity of Stars\u201d may seem like a love song intended for a woman in his life, Logic clarified in a <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/logic301\/status\/665519861435662336\">tweet<\/a> saying, \u201cCity of Stars is a break up song with hip hop, written to be perceived as a person (so the listener can embrace it however they want) and finally not giving a s**t about what that person thinks or allowing their opinion to drag down my artistic integrity or how I create. ... It is a goodbye to \u2018how a person should make hip hop\u2019 and a hello \u2018to finally embracing and focusing on Genre-less Music.\u2019\u201d Logic uses more of his singing element to spread his statement on hip hop during the first half of the song, and then switches the flow to rap-discuss hip hop issues including studio deals, drugs and race. \u201cCity of Stars\u201d hits home, and Logic provides a connection between listeners and himself.\r\n\r\nSong 14: \u201cParadise\u201d\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/embed.spotify.com\/?uri=spotify%3Atrack%3A0M2ZekrsEkru9Xp5rWnouQ\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\nRapping over a smooth drum beat highlighted by hi-hats and cymbals, Logic takes us through a timeline of his life. He flashes back to brief images of his father's departure, his mother's arrest, and his rise to fame. Perhaps this is what makes Logic so special: his ability to paint images of the harsher realities of not only his life, but embrace the major conflicts of America. And of course, Logic brings the musical fluidity to the track, slowing down and speeding back up in milliseconds between rhymes. \u201cParadise\u201d is full of double meanings, and Logic searches for his perfect world as Thomas and Kai search for theirs.\r\n\r\nSong 18: \u201cThe Incredible True Story\u201d\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/embed.spotify.com\/?uri=spotify%3Atrack%3A5FhaG2uuOPmPcGXO9aniCH\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\nThe last track is a three-part finale: a trio of verses, a sample of the speech \u201cWhat If Money Was No Object\u201d by Alan Watts and a closing scene of Thomas and Kai reaching Paradise. The verses touch on the importance of the nature of hip hop rather than the money and accolades. As usual, Logic delivers with seamless transitions and flawless flow. The speech continues on the message of money from the beginning of the song. It emphasizes the importance of living our lives to the fullest and doing the things we love during our time on Earth.\r\nFinally, the last scene reveals that Thomas and Kai have finally found Paradise, and they discuss Quentin Tarantino movies and Logic\u2019s music, showing Logic's love for his favorite movie director. When Kai and Thomas eventually land and step out of the ship, they hear insects chirping and animals snuffling. When Thomas asks what the sound is, Thalia responds with \u201cLife.\u201d \u201cThe Incredible True Story\u201d is the perfect conclusion to Logic\u2019s second studio album.\r\n\r\nLogic executes every track to perfection. The album is sure to be on repeat for an indefinite amount of time, and I highly suggest you give it a listen; \u201cThe Incredible True Story\u201d is an utterly gorgeous sound that is, well, out of this world.","excerpt":"Logic's sophomore album \"The Incredible True Story\" displays the rapper's lyrical creativity and seamless flow, all the while digging deep into his personal life.","date":"2015-11-17 00:01:03","author":"Sam Lee","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/1800x1800sr.jpg","categories":["Reviews","Spotlight"],"tags":["hip hop","logic","music","rap","review","song","the incredible true story"]},{"id":111591,"title":"Coffee Chats: English teacher Alanna Williamson","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/11\/15\/coffee-chats-english-teacher-alanna-williamson\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_111603\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"371\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/alannawilliamson.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-111603\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/alannawilliamson.jpg\" alt=\"alannawilliamson\" width=\"371\" height=\"424\" \/><\/a> English teacher Alanna Williamson drinks an eggnog latte while sharing why she is passionate about English and offering some of her best advice for current students.

She teaches both English 10\/10A and American Literature for juniors. According to Williamson she would love to teach an elective in upcoming years. Along with teaching English, Williamson is the assistant coach for Paly\u2019s dance team and even helped lead the teacher dance during Spirit Week.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m an assistant coach,\" Williamson said. \"It\u2019s fun. She [dance teacher Hillary McDaniels] organized and I helped. We co-choreographed. I loved Spirit Week.\u201d\r\n\r\nWilliamson grew up near Palo Alto in Sunnyvale and graduated from Fremont High School. During her high school career, she\u00a0participated in theater and was the president of the spoken word poetry club at her school. After graduation, she attended De Anza College for three years before transferring to University of California, Los Angeles. Williamson was always passionate about English and knew that\u00a0if her theatrical dreams did not work out she would like to pursue a career in English education.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was thinking about pursuing theatre and Broadway and when that didn't pan out, I had to refocus,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cAnd I really loved talking about education with people. A lot of my friends had a lot of problems in the way the education system is [run] so I want to help fix that.\u201d\r\n\r\nHaving graduated from school relatively recently, Williamson says she is able to relate to her students and the problems they face each day.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think that there still needs to be that student-teacher line,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cBut I do want you guys to know that it really wasn't that long ago that I went through all the same stuff that you're going through now and that I can talk to you guys and support you through everything.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Williamson, Paly itself is not the place to blame for student stress, but rather the Palo Alto student environment as a whole.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI think that there's so much that the teachers do all the time with the way that they conduct their classes and the different things being set into place at Paly that are there to really support students,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cI think it has to do more with the community we\u2019re in, and the environment and the fact that [Stanford] is across the street staring at us every day and just kind of looming.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\nThe biggest advice that Williamson has for students about stress or feeling down is to not be ashamed to talk to someone about it.\r\n\r\n\u201cTalk to somebody,\" Williamson said. \"Don\u2019t feel ashamed because it's such a human experience. Everyone\u2019s going through it. It's just because we live in silence all the time so people feel like you should feel bad about it. You really don't have to feel bad about it. And you\u2019ll get better.\u201d\r\n\r\nHaving gone through the college application process herself recently, Williamson believes that sometimes going to community college and transferring to another school can be a good option.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t ruin your life trying to stress out about it now and feel sad if you can\u2019t make it for some reason that\u2019s completely out of your control when you can instead plan your future in a different way,\" Williamson said. \"That would be more beneficial for you.\"\r\n\r\nWilliamson loves teaching at Paly and thinks of it as a unique\u00a0opportunity that she plans to continue career for as long as possible.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt's a pretty cross your heart thing getting placed somewhere like Paly, so as long as they want me, I\u2019ll stay,\u201d Williamson said.<\/span>","excerpt":"The Paly Voice sat down with english teacher Alanna Williamson over an iced eggnog latte to discuss how the new school year is going and her best advice for students.\r\n","date":"2015-11-15 22:15:08","author":"Morgan Keller","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/alannawilliamson.jpg","categories":["Coffee chats","Entertainment","Uncategorized"],"tags":["coffee","coffee chat","english","ms. williamson","Teacher","williamson"]},{"id":112024,"title":"Advisory this week is for all freshmen and juniors","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/11\/14\/advisory-this-week-is-for-all-freshmen-and-juniors\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2015-11-14 23:17:12","author":"Josh Yuen","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]}]
