If we continue to work hard and play strategically, I think we have a good shot at making it to CCS.\"\r\n\r\nDespite high hopes, Harader stresses the difficult\u00a0competition in the De Anza League, which the team moved up to this year.\r\n\r\n\"Our league is the best in NorCal [Northern California] and Central California, loaded with highly ranked players, so [the league is] extremely difficult,\" Harader said. \"We have several ranked players but just not as high.\"\r\n\r\nWang sees room for improvement as the team adjusts to the intense\u00a0competitiveness\u00a0of the league.\r\n\r\n\"I think we can still improve in regards to our aggressiveness in match play,\" Wang said. \"Since we moved up from a lower league last year, many of us are still determining how to approach opponents who aren't afraid to attack quickly, but I definitely think we will improve as the team gains more experience\"\r\n\r\nThe Viking's next match is against Homestead High School (3-0, 1-0) at 3:30 p.m. today at home.\r\n\r\n\"I know that our team is hungry for a league win, so we have a good shot at beating Homestead,\" Wang said.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School girls' tennis team (0-2, 6-4) looks to improve upon its league record after winning the Paly Invitational Tennis Tournament on Saturday.","date":"2015-09-22 15:32:34","author":"Takaaki Sagawa","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/IMG_2332.jpg","categories":["Sports"],"tags":{"56278":"andy","56281":"autumn","56280":"captain","12358":"coach","8693":"Fall","41285":"girl","8734":"girls","56279":"harder","56282":"invitaitonal","56277":"kelsey","8939":"palo alto","9120":"sports","10016":"tennis","9175":"tournament","9223":"Wang"}},{"id":108152,"title":"Hybrid Chemistry class blends regular and Honor courses","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/09\/22\/hybrid-chemistry-class-blends-regular-and-honor-courses\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_108446\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"375\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/Screen-Shot-2015-09-17-at-5.17.13-PM2.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-108446\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/Screen-Shot-2015-09-17-at-5.17.13-PM2.png\" alt=\"Students in the hybrid Chemistry course experience both Chemistry Honors and normal Chemistry together in the same class.

Photo by Ethan Kao.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nPalo Alto High School is offering a new hybrid Chemistry class this year,\u00a0which gives students more options throughout the course.\r\n\r\nThe hybrid class has a mix of students who signed up for either Chemistry Honors or Chemistry. According to Chemistry teacher Ron Bowditch, students get to choose which level of work they want to do.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have honors students and regular students in the same class,\" said Bowditch.\"Honor-level students still do honor-level chemistry work. In fact, the same stuff they do in Honors class. Regular Chemistry students still do the same stuff as regular Chemistry.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Science Instructional Supervisor Kelli Hagen, the new class offers students the ability to experience Chemistry Honors without fearing its academic rigor.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's our [Hagen and Bowditch] belief that students are afraid to take Honors because they\u2019ve heard that it is really hard and scary,\u201d Hagen said. \u201cTruly there's not a big jump between [Chemistry] Honors and regular Chemistry.\"\r\n\r\nSophomore Nandini Relan said, \u201cI took the hybrid class because I had been in Biology Honors and I wasn't sure which lane I wanted to take. I signed up for Chem but I wasn't sure if I should've or shouldn't have. The hybrid class ended up solving that problem.\u201d\r\n\r\nIf the students decide to stay in the hybrid Chemistry class, they can get credit depending on which work they do, according to Bowditch.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe also have quizzes every Wednesday and there is an honors and a regular quiz.\u201d sophomore Nandini Relan said. \u201cyou do have to do specific work to get Chem H credit.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe students also have the opportunity to move up into Chemistry Honors or move down into regular Chemistry if they would like. Six students have already taken advantage of this opportunity, according to Hagen.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat we were hoping was more students move into the Honors direction and that is what has been happening,\u201d Hagen said. \u201cWe are four weeks in and we have six\u00a0students that want to move up. They \u2026 want to move up because they are seeing this [Chemistry Honors work] and they are saying, 'I can do this too.'\"","excerpt":"Palo Alto High School is offering a new hybrid Chemistry class this year, which gives students more options throughout the course.","date":"2015-09-22 15:17:54","author":"Chirag Akella","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/Screen-Shot-2015-09-17-at-5.17.13-PM.png","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"54460":"Akella","54458":"Bowditch","11624":"chemistry","54457":"Chemistry Honors","54459":"Hagen","54456":"Honors","54462":"Hybrid","54461":"Kao"}},{"id":108299,"title":"What&#8217;s new at Club Day?","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/09\/22\/whats-new-at-club-day\/","content":"Looking to be more involved on campus, try something new and unique or just have a little extra fun in the 2015-16 school year?
