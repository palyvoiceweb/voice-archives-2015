[{"id":100058,"title":"Opinion: Blended learning proposes better alternative to traditional learning experience","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/02\/26\/opinion-blended-learning-is-better\/","content":"While the learning environment at school is satisfactory for some, to others, it is too uniform. School has been taught the same for generations, and lacks many areas of passion and further projects to develop these. While the current American teaching system involves many lectures and tests\u00a0that are\u00a0not as conducive to finding and delving into one's passion as they\u00a0could be, a learning environment in which students have complete freedom to do as much or as little work as they choose does not seem right either. So, the question is, how can we find a balance?\r\n\r\nPalo Alto High School journalism adviser Esther Wojcicki pushes for blended learning, a possibly solution.\r\n\r\nWojcicki\u2019s new book \"Moonshots in Education\" and recent presentation at Paly\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/02\/08\/paly-hosts-second-annual-tedx\/\">TEDx<\/a> talk earlier this month discuss the concept of blended learning, or a way to \u201cteach 21st century skills without lecturing to students,\u201d as she described it in a recent <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/01\/29\/voice-qa-journalism-teacher-wojcicki-introduces-new-book\/\">interview<\/a> with The Paly Voice. Her book describes how to change the culture of the classroom and revolutionize the American school system.\r\n\r\nWe whole-heartedly agree with this style of teaching as it encourages students to take control of their own learning. The current rigid structure of some classes traps many high school students in an educational system they do not feel passionate learning in. Learning extends far beyond sitting behind a desk for 90 minutes while listening to a teacher\u00a0lecture. For certain classes, like classes in STEM subjects, it is understandable that lectures\u00a0are unavoidable \u2013 it would be pretty hard to figure out how to design and code your own website without any prior lessons. That being said, there can still be ways for learning to branch off into innovative territories.\r\n\r\nPhysics teacher Gul Eris is one of several Paly teachers who have implemented\u00a0blended learning into their class curriculums. Having introduced the new format last fall, she strays away from the traditional teaching style of class lectures and homework and instead provides lecture videos for students to watch at home and practice problems or labs to do in class.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve noticed in the past is that some students struggle to keep up with writing stuff [during class lectures] or cannot pay full attention in class,\u201d Eris said. \u201cSo, if they can do it [learn the material] on their own terms in their own time, where they can make it [the lecture video] as slow or as fast as they want it to be, they can pay better attention and take better notes and can reach a better understanding of the concepts.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe numbers speak favorably in support of her theory.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe test scores are a little bit higher compared to last year,\u201d Eris said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a lot, but [they're] still higher.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a huge challenge to fit a square peg into a round hole \u2014 and even harder to fit each person's individual learning preferences into a strict, cookie-cutter model. That's why education should be personalized with blended learning. Students are currently unmotivated to learn in school, which detracts from the overall enjoyment of school. With blended learning, however, learning is more personalized, and students will be given the opportunity to pursue their true interests. The American high school system is too factory-like and not conducive to success because interests do not exactly lie in the domain. Ultimately, we push for teachers to experiment more with blended learning in classrooms\u00a0because it allows students to take control of their learning experience.","excerpt":"While the learning environment at school is satisfactory for some, to others, it is too uniform.

And chances are, you most definitely did not log on to your computer or turn on your phone with the intention of reading\u00a0this specific article. Perhaps you were\u00a0browsing your social media feeds or watching that funny video your friend sent you before you somehow stumbled upon\u00a0this article.\r\n\r\nIn your Internet-accessing excitement,\u00a0did you for one second pause and think of the principle of net neutrality and how it affects the way you interact with your information?\u00a0Probably not, but a vote to be taken Thursday on the issue of net neutrality by\u00a0the Federal Communications Commission,\u00a0the governing body for the Internet in the U.S., might fundamentally change the kind of information you access and make you think more critically about where you're getting your information.\r\n\r\nThe Paly Voice summarizes the issue at hand and presents them in five minutes or less.\r\n\r\n<b> What is net neutrality?<\/b>\r\n\r\nThe point of dispute\u00a0behind the vote Thursday is whether the principle of\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.fcc.gov\/openinternet\" target=\"_blank\">net neutrality<\/a>\u00a0should be preserved. According to the FCC, net neutrality is simply the idea that all information on the Internet should be treated equally and that consumers are able to freely make choices on the type of content they access.\r\n\r\n<b>What are the issues at stake?<\/b>\r\n\r\nIn April of last year, FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler proposed a plan to allow Internet Service Providers (companies you pay to access the Internet like AT&amp;T and Comcast), or ISPs, to create high-speed fast lanes for those who pay a premium, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.savetheinternet.com\/net-neutrality-what-you-need-know-now\">according to Free Press<\/a>. However, this proposal violates the basis\u00a0of net neutrality: to treat all data equally.\r\n\r\nIf such a proposal went through, companies willing to shell out the big bucks would have their data prioritized over everyone else's, and smaller websites belonging to small businesses, non-profits, schools, individuals \u2013 websites like yours truly \u2013 would be subject to regular-speed (read: slow) lanes. Even though\u00a0websites not paying premiums to ISPs would still be accessible, the Free Press\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.savetheinternet.com\/net-neutrality-what-you-need-know-now\" target=\"_blank\">website<\/a> on net neutrality warns that this is a precursor to possible censorship of information on behalf of the ISPs by slowing \u201cregularly laned\u201d information to such a pace that it can\u2019t be accessed.\r\n\r\nAfter the proposal, the FCC opened up an online comment forum, which resulted in a record number\u00a0of responses (thanks in part to a<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fpbOEoRrHyU\"> \"Last Week Tonight with John Oliver\" episode<\/a>). The proposal was narrowly denied by a 3 to 2 vote, and the idea of \u201cfast lane\u201d was fortuitously dropped. Now, the FCC will instead be taking a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/fcc-chairman-confirms-net-neutrality-vote-for-february\/\" target=\"_blank\">vote on\u00a0Feb. 26<\/a>\u00a0to\u00a0reclassify ISPs as Title II carriers, a grouping that\u00a0currently applies to telecommunication service companies. Under this new classification, there will be heavier government involvement in regulation with the supposed intent of minimizing the chances that more proposals like that introduced last April appear or somehow get passed.\r\n\r\n<b>Why are people divided on this issue?<\/b>\r\n\r\nLike most political issues, people are divided on the role that the government should play in people's lives. In theory, by putting the Internet under government control, it becomes harder for a few firms to monopolize the ISP market and easier for smaller firms and start ups to succeed. As a result, more competition exists, and if one company unfairly jacks up the prices (as people suspect they might), the consumer can simply switch providers.\r\n\r\nHowever, history has shown that the government is never necessarily the cure-all for any given problem. For example, look at the criticisms directed at the new ObamaCare initiative. On the last official day of ObamaCare enrollment, the website crashed, and recently, about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.washingtontimes.com\/news\/2015\/feb\/20\/obamacare-officials-give-penalty-payers-extra-time\/\">800,000 customers<\/a>\u00a0received faulty tax information from the site. Furthermore, lobbyists' influence in politics (as exemplified by last April\u2019s debacle) makes some weary about the future of government-controlled neutrality.\r\n\r\nWhile politicians have been debating this issue for quite some time now, senior members of the Republican Party announced yesterday that they will probably not act against the upcoming policy shift with\u00a0a legislative response.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, most people agree that net neutrality is a basic right and should be universally existent. The central issue lies in how we arrive at that final destination; based on one\u2019s political ideology, the government may or may not be involved.","excerpt":"A vote to be taken Thursday on the issue of net neutrality might fundamentally change the kind of information you access and make you think more critically about where you're getting your information.

It's a time when students' voices can be most powerful, too.\"\r\n\r\nLiu adds that in order to make an impact in the Paly and Palo Alto community students must take the initiative by showing up to the event.\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing but positive outcomes for this event,\" Liu said. \"I think it's just a matter of students taking the initiative to come to the MAC on Thursday. ...

Photo by Nika Woodfill.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nA <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/measles\/cases-outbreaks.html\">recent measles outbreak<\/a> that has affected at least 141 people across 17 states, including <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cdph.ca.gov\/HealthInfo\/discond\/Pages\/MeaslesSurveillanceUpdates.aspx\">two\u00a0in Santa Clara County<\/a>, has sparked a national conversation about the importance of vaccinations in maintaining public health.\r\n\r\nSomething of this magnitude, the reemergence of a potentially life-threatening disease, would usually generate much public discourse in Palo Alto. But alas, save for the occasional diatribe found on Palo Alto Online\u2019s Town Square, our reaction to the outbreak has been pretty subdued. After all, we\u00a0Palo Altans have been <em>entirely <\/em>responsible\u00a0when it comes to getting our shots, and as <em>rational, highly scientific beings<\/em>, completely acknowledge the necessity of vaccinations in preserving public health. We all know that it\u2019s really just the uneducated, impoverished, and\/or religious fundamentalist demographic groups that refuse to get their kids vaccinated and essentially allow infectious diseases to proliferate in the population.\r\n\r\nBut that\u2019s not true.\r\n\r\nContrary to popular belief, the anti-vaccination movement is most prevalent in wealthy, educated and generally liberal enclaves. Take, for example, the cities of Santa Monica and Beverly Hills. In these affluent suburbs, droves of parents have filled out personal belief exemptions, or PBEs, meaning that their children\u00a0can attend school despite not having the required shots because they have a moral objection to the vaccines. According to an an <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hollywoodreporter.com\/features\/los-angeles-vaccination-rates\/\">expos\u00e9 written by The Hollywood Reporter in 2014<\/a>, close to 70 percent of parents have submitted personal belief exemptions in certain Southern California private schools, making the vaccination rates at those schools lower than those found in some developing countries.\r\n\r\nThankfully, the percentage of unvaccinated kids in Palo Alto is not even close to those frighteningly high numbers, and several schools in PAUSD \u00a0have a perfect or near-perfect vaccination record. That being said, data shows that there is a minuscule, surreptitious anti-vax movement within our city, and we need to pay attention.\r\n\r\nAccording to information from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.shotsforschool.org\/k-12\/how-doing\/\">ShotsForSchool.org<\/a>, an affiliate of the California Department of Public Health, approximately six percent of kindergarteners at Addison Elementary School in Palo Alto are inadequately vaccinated because their parents have submitted PBEs. This number seems laughably insignificant, but with a disease as infectious as measles, these few unvaccinated children could pose a serious threat to\u00a0other students, especially those with compromised immune systems who, for medical reasons, cannot be vaccinated. Individuals with weak immune systems are highly susceptible to contracting illnesses, and have virtually no defense against disease. If I was a parent of a child who cannot receive the proper shots for medical reasons, I would, rightfully so, be very scared about this measles outbreak.\r\n\r\nWe believe ourselves to be an enlightened and progressive community; the importance and infallibility of science is stressed by a great many. Yet somehow, there are people who apparently spurn medical facts (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/vaccinesafety\/Concerns\/Autism\/antigens.html\">vaccines do NOT cause autism<\/a>) and potentially put people\u2019s lives in jeopardy. Beyond being just plain wrong about the science behind vaccinations, anti-vaccination folks\u00a0are morally negligent and show a wanton disregard for both their children's health and the general wellbeing\u00a0of the public.\r\n\r\nThough its proponents aren\u2019t vocal, nor is it widely accepted, the anti-vax movement has somehow seeped into Palo Alto. This goes to show that even a city heralded as an epicenter of technological progress\u00a0isn\u2019t immune to the dogma of this illogical campaign.\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of Palo Altans dutifully take their children to the doctor\u2019s office for the proper shots and willingly comply with medical requirements, but in some ways, it seems almost as if we\u2019ve forgotten what damage infectious disease can inflict upon us. After years of relative safety and no large-scale epidemics (other than the largely underground HIV\/AIDS epidemic) in the United States over the past few decades, infectious disease is no longer at the forefront of our minds. In fact, we seem to be amnesic when it comes to maladies: The 1918 Spanish influenza outbreak, the most devastating pandemic in the history of mankind, is but an obscure blurb in a dusty history textbook. Polio, smallpox, tuberculosis and other dastardly diseases that terrified and crippled the U.S. population less than a century ago are rarely mentioned, even by medical practitioners. Advances in medicine over the past 50 years or so have successfully assuaged our fears, and as a result, we\u2019ve become almost ignorant of the horrors brought about by infectious disease.\r\n\r\nIn our never-ending race to innovate, and\u00a0move society forward scientifically, we sometimes lose sight of the past. It\u2019s imperative that we continue to progress but remain cognizant of our history. We can\u2019t forget why we get shots and work actively to improve medicine: T0 protect ourselves, to the best of our abilities, from the indiscriminate onslaught of germs.\r\n\r\nThis current measles outbreak is a formidable reminder that a select few in one of the most highly educated and affluent communities -- our community -- are rejecting well-established medical claims in favor of rhetoric from anti-vax demagogues. But more importantly, the rise in measles cases across the United States demonstrates that we haven\u2019t conquered disease; clearly, we have quite a bit of work to do as a nation if we want to avoid future public health disasters. Those of us who have been properly vaccinated have already solved part of the problem. The next step is to move away from our\u00a0collective sense of complacency. I'm not saying that we need to go out and\u00a0start\u00a0what would essentially be a witch-hunt for all people who may be opposed\u00a0to vaccinations. What we do need to do is\u00a0acknowledge that infectious disease has not been eradicated, and be more aware of the fact that\u00a0it poses a very real threat to our livelihood.","excerpt":"In light of a recent measles outbreak that has affected at least 141 people across 17 states, including two in Santa Clara County, staff writer Dhara Yu weighs in on public health issues which plague our community.","date":"2015-02-24 13:50:09","author":"Dhara Yu","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/DSC_0001.jpg","categories":["Opinion","Spotlight"],"tags":{"39059":"anti-vaccination movement","39058":"anti-vax","39061":"disease","39056":"infectious disease","39055":"measles","8927":"opinion","39060":"outbreak","8939":"palo alto","8944":"palo alto high school","8977":"PAUSD","39057":"public health"}},{"id":98589,"title":"From a #SSS: Narrowing your college list","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/02\/24\/from-a-sss-narrowing-your-college-list\/","content":"As second semester seniors (a.k.a. #SSS), we have begun to reflect back on our high school experiences and look to pass along helpful advice and lessons we have learned.\r\n\r\nFor Palo Alto High School juniors looking toward next year, the college application process may seem like it's looming over your\u00a0heads. Narrowing your college list is the first step in what can be a long, and arduous process. Finalizing which colleges and universities you wish to apply to can take months, so it\u2019s best to start as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nHere are a few tips that we found helpful in narrowing down our own lists:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><b>Check out or buy college books<\/b><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nThere are close to 4,000 colleges in the United States, which can be extremely overwhelming. Luckily, a good way to dip your toes into the ocean of colleges is to start flipping through a college guide book, such as the \"Fiske Guide to Colleges\" or The Princeton Review's \"The Best 379 Colleges.\" These books offer an overview of many schools, various stats and some insight into student life. You can get a sense for what schools are out there and what you want in a college by skimming through the books and picking out attributes that appeal to you. These books can be purchased in bookstores and online or rented out for free at the College and Career Center or at a local library.\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><b>List out attributes<\/b><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nAfter getting a sense for what's out there, it's a good time to focus in on what you specifically want. One of the strategies that worked well for us is to divide the attributes we were looking for into two categories: must-haves and like-to-haves. Those under the must-haves would be deal-breakers (such as the student body size or location of campus), whereas those under like-to-haves are things you could see yourself living without (such as having a good football team or the type of weather on campus). There are many Internet resources that will give you suggestions based on requirements you input like <a href=\"https:\/\/connection.naviance.com\/family-connection\/auth\/login\/?hsid=pahs\">Naviance<\/a>\u00a0and <a href=\"https:\/\/bigfuture.collegeboard.org\/college-search\">The College Board<\/a>. There are also sites like <a href=\"https:\/\/colleges.niche.com\/\">College Prowler,\u00a0<\/a>which host reviews from actual students at that school.\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><b>Seek out advice<\/b><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nIf you start getting lost in the sea of college info that\u2019s out there, it may be time to talk to a professional. Luckily, that\u2019s exactly what the College and Career Center counselors are there for. All college-bound Paly juniors are recommended by their advisers to schedule a meeting with their corresponding C&amp;CC counselor \u2014\u00a0something we recommend being on top of, since the meeting time slots fill up quickly. These meetings can help focus your college list with their realistic advice and give you a different perspective on your college process so far. Paly grads are also good resources regarding the college process and are usually happy to give their advice if you reach out to them. Some may also choose to hire a private college advisor if they want additional services.\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><b>Visit colleges to get a feel for different kinds of campuses<\/b><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nIt\u2019s one thing to read about a college, but it's a whole other thing to actually experience a college. Knowing how you feel on a campus and getting placed in that environment can help you narrow down what you like in a college. You don\u2019t even have to go out of the Bay Area <span style=\"color: #252525;\">\u2014\u00a0<\/span>there are a variety of colleges within driving distance, such as Santa Clara University (27 minutes from Paly); University of California, Berkeley (59 minutes); Stanford University (5\u00a0minutes); and San Jose State University (32 minutes). Even if you aren\u2019t interested in that particular college, going to visit can help you understand how you\u2019d feel on a campus of that size, with that size of student body and in that environment. Sitting in on a class can also be invaluable in getting a feel for the classroom dynamics <span style=\"color: #252525;\">\u2014<\/span>\u00a0there are a range of styles from large lecture halls to smaller, discussion-based classrooms. Since this is a place you may hope to attend for a couple of years you want to know what the education you will be getting will be like. We recommend choosing a weekend or break to visit a variety of colleges.\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><b>Choose a variety<\/b><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nWe have all heard of the Ivies and the top 25 colleges in the country, but there are so many great colleges out there to choose from <span style=\"color: #252525;\">\u2014<\/span>\u00a0many you probably have never even heard about before. We recommend that you choose colleges because they have attributes that appeal to you, like a unique major or great school atmosphere, and not solely because of the name. That being said, dream big, but you should definitely have reasonable back ups. Also, don\u2019t overlook or underestimate safety or match schools. Naviance is a great tool to compare your academic statistics to former\u00a0Paly students who applied to schools you're interested in. Remember, these statistics are only a part of the application, but they are a great starting point to see how realistic your list is. Keep in mind\u00a0that any school on your list should be one where you see yourself succeeding and enjoying the next few years of your life.","excerpt":"As second semester seniors (a.k.a. #SSS), we have begun to reflect back on our high school experiences and look to pass along helpful advice and lessons we have learned.
