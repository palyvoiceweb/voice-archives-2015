Ask about more than just statistics and averages.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe college fair is a great way to learn about more than a\u00a0school's numbers. You can look up scores and statistical information online in your free time. In fact, if you ask admissions counselors and alumni for basic data, you may\u00a0come across as unprepared\u00a0instead of excited about the university.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Academic life<\/span>\r\n\r\nIt's important to ask about the academic life at the school. Make sure to bring up:\r\n\r\n\u2013 Work\/life balance\r\n\r\n\u2013 Studying outside your major\r\n\r\n\u2013 Unique programs offered\r\n\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Social life<\/span>\r\n\r\nAlthough academics are important, don't forget to ask about different ways you can get socially involved and connect with students at\u00a0the school, as this will help you determine whether you like\u00a0the school's culture. Ask about:\r\n\r\n\u2013 Clubs\r\n\r\n\u2013 Greek life\r\n\r\n\u2013 Community service and volunteer hours\r\n\r\n\u2013 Events on campus\r\n\r\n\u2013 How dorms are organized: by major, by interest, or random?\r\n\r\n\u2013 Fun traditions\r\n\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Work\/Career opportunities<\/span>\r\n\r\nAsking about work and career\u00a0opportunities demonstrates an impressive level of interest and maturity. Make sure you talk a little about:\r\n\r\n\u2013 Undergraduate research\r\n\r\n\u2013 Studying abroad\r\n\r\n\u2013 Internships\r\n\r\n\u2013 Alumni networks\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Engage in in-depth conversations instead of\u00a0focusing on visiting\u00a0every booth.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nMake sure to converse thoughtfully with as many representatives as you can. Wait at the booth rather than just skimming aisles and picking up packets. Representatives value the time you take to talk to them and are more likely to remember you when reading applications.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. If a representative is an alumnus, ask why they chose\u00a0the school.\u00a0<\/strong>\r\n\r\nTheir answer will help you write an authentic and honest\u00a0supplement about why you want to apply to their university, which provides a personalized story and can help you decide whether to apply.\r\n\r\n<strong>4. Follow up with emails to show interest. <\/strong>\r\n\r\nA common misconception is that you'll sound needy or annoying, but a genuine thank you shows representatives that you are truly interested in their school and helps them see you as a potential student. Asking additional questions\u00a0also\u00a0ensures they won't forget you.\r\n\r\nPaly's College and Career Center has also provided a list of things to do when attending a college fair.

We also did a good job mixing up our shots, either hitting the ball or tipping the ball.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Wilson, it was junior libero Cassie Fong\u2019s first time playing in that position, who usually plays as a setter, a new dynamic for the team. Fan also praised Fong\u2019s performance.\r\n\r\n\u201cCassie really stepped up and played libero really well,\u201d Fan said. \u201cShe\u2019s never played there before.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith huge turnouts in the student sections for both schools, the crowd noise and \u201cseventh-man\u201d in the gym affected play during the game, according to junior right side hitter Katie Passarello.\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought we kind of got a little spooked by Gunn\u2019s super loud crowd during the second and third games, but we were able to come back and calm ourselves down,\u201d Passarello said. \u201cWe did a really good job in controlling our emotions at the end.\u201d\r\n\r\nLooking forward, Paly will be focusing on its fundamentals as well as the team aspects of the game, according to Green.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe definitely need to work on serve-receive because we missed a lot of balls,\u201d Green said. \u201cAlso, just communication on the court and working together.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Vikings\u2019 next game is set for 6:45 p.m. on Oct. 13, an away game against the Los Gatos Wildcats (11-7, 3-2).\r\n<div id=\"cp_widget_317536eb-85b6-47ab-b844-bc816c85904e\">\r\n<div id=\"cp_widget_6935fb39-1dd7-4dab-bd05-59d52f4f6055\">\r\n\r\n...<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\/\/ <![CDATA[\r\nvar cpo = []; cpo[\"_object\"] =\"cp_widget_6935fb39-1dd7-4dab-bd05-59d52f4f6055\"; cpo[\"_fid\"] = \"AwCAh88qOWSg\";\r\nvar _cpmp = _cpmp || []; _cpmp.push(cpo);\r\n(function() { var cp = document.createElement(\"script\"); cp.type = \"text\/javascript\";\r\ncp.async = true; cp.src = \"\/\/www.cincopa.com\/media-platform\/runtime\/libasync.js\";\r\nvar c = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0];\r\nc.parentNode.insertBefore(cp, c); })(); \r\n\/\/ ]]><\/script><noscript>Powered by Cincopa <a href='http:\/\/www.cincopa.com\/video-hosting'>Video Hosting for Business<\/a> solution.<\/noscript>\r\n\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School volleyball team (167, 4-1) earned its fourth De Anza League victory over Gunn High School (10-9, 1-4) on Thursday at Gunn in a home game for Paly, with an end score of 3-2.","date":"2015-10-11 19:18:10","author":"Emma van der Veen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/IMG_3326.jpg","categories":["Sports","Sports Recap","Spotlight","Volleyball"],"tags":["cassie fong","Chelsea Fan","claire dennis","craig benkowski","fiona green","gunn","Jekara Wilson","jessica lee","katie passarello","palo alto high school","paly","sports","titans","vikings","volleyball"]},{"id":109644,"title":"College and Awareness Day is on Wednesday, Oct. 14","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/10\/11\/college-and-awareness-day-is-on-wednesday-oct-14\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2015-10-11 15:43:53","author":"Josh Yuen","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]},{"id":109641,"title":"Advisory this week is for all freshmen and seniors","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/10\/11\/advisory-this-week-is-for-all-freshmen-and-seniors\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2015-10-11 15:42:27","author":"Josh Yuen","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]},{"id":109454,"title":"ASB calls Spirit Swap a success","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/10\/11\/asb-calls-spirit-swap-a-success\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_109636\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"426\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/SPIRITSWAP1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-109636\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/SPIRITSWAP1.jpg\" alt=\"SPIRITSWAP\" width=\"426\" height=\"273\" \/><\/a> Students observe the array of spirit gear at the first Spirit Swap. \u201cIn the past, I have spent a lot of money buying stuff for Spirit Week and it\u2019s been hard to borrow from other grades,\u201d junior ASB Vice-President Anmol Nagar said. \u201cThis way, Spirit Week gear is more accessible to everyone.\u201d Photo by Aidan Maese-Czeropski.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nPalo Alto High School's Associated Student Body is calling the first Spirit Swap a success after it brought new gear to students in preparation for Spirit Week.\r\n\r\nThe Spirit Swap allowed students to exchange old items used at past Spirit Weeks for new items they can use this year.

Al-Shamari has never traveled alone for a long period of time, and looks forward to the new cultural she will experience. In her free time, Al-Shamari loves to travel, socialize and explore.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n<span style=\"line-height: 1.5;\"> I landed in Vienna, Austria on Sept. 4, simultaneously ecstatic and intimidated by what I would experience in this new country. Although I had visited my family and friends many times all throughout Eastern and Western Europe, I had never set foot in Austria.<\/span>\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve always been curious about the world. With my family living in Russia, Italy and Denmark (some fleeing from Baghdad during the disasters of the Iraq war), I\u2019ve been able to see quite a bit of the world. But studying abroad is a different story. Although I have traveled on my own, it has never been for such a long period of time.\r\n\r\nI decided to take my semester abroad in Austria because I wanted to experience a culture different from the one in Palo Alto. Austria's cultural variances, many that I will talk about in future blogs, give an alternative perspective of the world.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I\u2019ve noticed a few things about Austria since arriving. Austria is known for its more quiet and calm way of living. As a nation, it hasn\u2019t lastingly made international headlines since Arnold Schwarzenegger won the Mister Universe contest in 1969.\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/youtu.be\/c7Iaz_r2t-g\r\nThat is until the largest population migration in modern history hit Europe, and hard. According to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2015\/09\/03\/world\/gallery\/europes-refugee-crisis\/\">CNN<\/a>, more than 300,000 refugees and migrants have fled\u00a0to Europe in 2015\u00a0to escape war\u00a0in the Middle East. In recent weeks, Austria has found itself at the center of the migration crisis, with about 80,000 people seeking asylum in the country just this year, according to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2015\/aug\/27\/austria-western-europes-migration-crisis-starts-here\">Guardian<\/a>.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the same day I flew into Vienna, an international news headline flashed\u00a0on the airport television:\r\n\r\n\"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/worldnews\/europe\/11843189\/EU-refugee-crisis-Migrants-in-Bicske-station-Hungary-siege-continues-overnight-live.html\">Migration crisis:<\/a> Desperate refugees escape camps and start a 110-mile trek to Austria\"\r\n\r\nSoon thereafter, I was reading on The New York Times about migrants who crossed the Austrian border from Hungary.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/09\/05\/world\/europe\/migrant-crisis-hungary.html?_r=0\">NICKELSDORF, Austria<\/a>\u00a0\u2014 \u00a0\"Thousands of migrants who have been bottled up in Hungary, demanding passage to the West, will be allowed into Austria and Germany, the Austrian chancellor said late Friday. Early Saturday, the first buses carrying them arrived at the Hungary-Austria border.\"\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I realized that Austria was all over the news as thousands of refugees flooded the typically tranquil European nation. It has truly made its way to the roots of my experience here, as a refugee camp is located a block away from my school, and a new flood of people seek asylum almost every night.<\/span>\r\n\r\nDuring my stay here in Austria, I hope to bring a new perspective to Paly. Everything changes by the hour, and I look forward to giving you international updates. Keep watch for my next blog post.

Svirsky was pulled from the position later in the season and moved to wide receiver in favor of teammate Justin Hull, a senior who last week led the Vikings to a <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/10\/04\/football-takes-down-saratoga-in-league-opener\/\">42-35 double-overtime victory<\/a> over the Saratoga Falcons (1-3, 0-1).\r\n\r\nWhile Svirsky regained the position for the team's final two games when Hull suffered a concussion late last season, he transferred this past summer to Milpitas and earned the starting quarterback role there.\r\n\r\nAlthough Friday's matchup will be the first time Svirsky faces his former teammates, he says he is treating the game like any other.\r\n\r\n\"I'm just taking it as another game just like my teammates and as another chance to go out to war with my brothers here like every week,\" Svirsky said.\r\n\r\nThis season, Svirsky currently has five touchdown passes, five rushing touchdowns and two interceptions, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.maxpreps.com\/high-schools\/milpitas-trojans-(milpitas,ca)\/football\/stats.htm\">according to Maxpreps.com<\/a>. On the flip side, Hull has 14 touchdowns but seven interceptions.\r\n\r\nThe Trojans present an up-tempo offense for the Vikings' defense, paced by a trifecta of running backs each with at least 30 carries on the season: seniors Cros Chavez and Dejaun Crummie and sophomore Tariq Bracy.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings opened up league play strongly last week as Hull accounted for five of the team's six touchdowns.\r\n\r\nAccording to Hull's leading wide receiver Eli Givens, the team will be facing a big challenge in the Trojans' defensive line.\r\n\r\n\"We are going to be facing a very good defensive-line that will try and scare us with their size and will have to overcome that,\" Givens said.\r\n\r\nSvirsky remains confident in his team's ability to stick to it's game plan, even against his old team.\r\n\r\n\"We are focused on playing our game,\" Svirsky said. \"It's not about the opposing team, it's about us and playing our game.\"\r\n\r\nGivens, who grew up as one of Svirsky's close friends, noted that playing his friend will make the game interesting.\r\n\r\n\"I think it will be exciting to play [Svirsky],\" Givens said. \"I have never played against one of my closest friends like this in football and it will be interesting. I think it won't affect the game that much though because we know what we have to do to win and I think we are ready.\"\r\n\r\nThe game will kick off at 7 p.m. tomorrow at Milpitas High School.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School football team (2-3, 1-0) will look to earn it's second De Anza league win when it travels to Milpitas High School this Friday to take on the Trojans (3-2, 1-0), a team led by a familiar face to the Vikings.","date":"2015-10-08 21:31:23","author":"Josh Yuen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/PaulJIII.jpg","categories":["Football","Sports","Spotlight"],"tags":["givens","halas","hull","milpitas","Paly football","svirsky"]},{"id":109347,"title":"Model United Nations to participate in intergenerational conference","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/10\/08\/model-united-nations-to-participate-in-intergenerational-conference\/","content":"Palo Alto High School's Model United Nations club will attend its first conference of the year this weekend at University of California, Berkeley.\r\n\r\nThe Intergenerational Model UN conference is a unique conference in that it gives the opportunity for delegates of any age to participate, according to MUN researcher Tara Madhav.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt's not only a high school conference, but for delegates who are adults and even middle schoolers,\u201d Madhav said. \u201cIt's really for anyone who is interested in Model UN.\u201d\r\n\r\nMUN is a club intended for students to learn and discuss current world politics and events. For\u00a0conferences such as the Intergenerational conference, each student will be assigned a committee with a specific topic and a country. Students must then research their country and its position. They will then write a paper and debate\u00a0with other delegates to find a solution.\r\n\r\nAccording to Madhav, the Intergenerational conference is more educational and slow-paced in comparison to other MUN conferences. However, Madhav hopes the conference will serve to get the veteran delegates accustomed to the process once more, and give the new delegates a feel for MUN conferences.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_109348\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"481\"]<img class=\"wp-image-109348\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/12076931_825233570926770_1643289003_n.jpg\" alt=\"12076931_825233570926770_1643289003_n\" width=\"481\" height=\"361\" \/> Paly's Model United Nation (MUN) delegates and advisors pose at last year's Intergenerational conference.

It\u2019s not only the theorems and all of that, but the homework problems are more complicated so I have to do them all myself so I know what\u2019s going on. If a student asks a question I don\u2019t like to be in the front of the room thinking about it for the first time. I like to be able to say \u201cOh yeah, there\u2019s this sneaky step here, or a lot of students do this when this works,\" so it\u2019s definitely taken a lot of extra preparation, but I love it. I love teaching BC, and I loved teaching AB. Calculus is fun.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TPV: Do you prefer teaching seniors or freshmen?<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DP: Again, I don\u2019t really have a preference. It\u2019s apples and oranges. All the students are nice. I\u2019m fortunate to be teaching BC and Geo H this year, which are both in the honors lane. When I started out here I was teaching the Geometry regular [class] and sometimes you could get a couple of characters. But everybody\u2019s so nice in the honors lane, even if they\u2019re struggling with the calculus. I just have a really great relationship with my classes, and it\u2019s been that way for a couple years. It\u2019s kind of hard to complain about though, it\u2019s not Los Angeles Unified [School District], there\u2019s no metal detector when you enter the school. But occasionally you\u2019ll have a rambunctious group, depending on the grade and section you\u2019re teaching.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TPV: Do you have a\u00a0favorite theorem?<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DP: Usually when I go home, I stop thinking about math. Some people who live and breathe math, they might have a favorite theorem, but I\u2019m not that guy.<\/span>\u00a0I think I\u2019m good at math, and I\u2019m really good at explaining things to people, and I think that\u2019s what makes me a good math teacher. You could be a genius at math and be terrible at explaining things to people and that would make you a bad teacher, and I definitely had a couple of those in college. ... I think I love teaching more than I love math.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TPV: How would you describe your Twitter aesthetic?<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DP: Sadly, I have not been on Twitter as much as I have been on [it] in the past, because my life is just so busy, but I say that every semester. Last semester I was finishing graduate school, the semester before that I was taking two classes and I had just had a baby. The semester before that I was in the middle of graduate school and my wife was pregnant. I kept looking forward and I thought \u201cOh, well, once graduate school\u2019s done,\u201d but this semester we moved to a new house, which is bananas, and my wife is pregnant again and we\u2019re going to have another baby in January, and the BC was dropped on me. And so now, where I didn\u2019t think I was going to have a new class this year, it\u2019s not just any class, it\u2019s the BC Calculus where I have to do every problem. I would like to tweet more, but it's just that sometimes I go home and I just need to sit on the couch, you know what I mean?<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have a separate Twitter account, where I follow people\u00a0but\u00a0I don\u2019t really tweet, and I have a public account. When you teach, they say for instance \"Don\u2019t become Facebook friends with your students because there\u2019s this awkward line and you don\u2019t want to cross over it.\" So, I knew if I was going to have a Twitter account I couldn\u2019t \"work blue,\" it would have to be very clean, so if any parent or board member read them they\u2019d have to be okay. I realized some of the comedians I follow are so dirty I don\u2019t even want to be connected with them that way, so my Twitter account is very sanitized ...\u00a0but I still try to be as humorous as I can with it, and you know, sometimes I just tweet a picture of my daughter because she\u2019s awesome.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\nTPV: Do you have any tips for relaxation, or managing time, or things that you wish students did that would make their lives easier?\r\n\r\nDP: You know, that\u2019s a really good question. It\u2019s tough because I think it varies so much from person to person. I think we all say this is a stressful environment, but it affects different people in different ways. \u00a0If you tell one person you need to do relaxation exercises and yoga, it might be great for them and for other people it might not work at all. And so, it\u2019s hard to just say \u201cHere\u2019s one thing everyone can do\u201d because I don\u2019t think that counts. I don\u2019t think there is a thing like that. But I get it man, I\u2019m really stressed, I always feel like I have a million things going on.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TPV: What was your least favorite class in high school?<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DP: I would say my least favorite subject was history, but I was still pretty lucky because I still had really great teachers. I had one guy my freshman and junior year for Advanced Placement U.S History. I didn\u2019t do well in APUSH, I didn\u2019t take the exam, but I loved my history teacher. So, even with something that I was not a big fan of, I ended up liking it because of the teacher. I think the teacher can be very make-or-break, I think sometimes you hear students say things like \u201cI hate math,\u201d and maybe it\u2019s not the math. Maybe it\u2019s because in 6th grade they had some teacher who was awful, who just derailed them, and they just assumed it was something with them and not the instruction. But I don\u2019t think I had a least favorite course in high school. I definitely like math a lot because I was good at it and it came naturally to me, but otherwise I was pretty ok with the rest of my courses. There wasn\u2019t anything I hated.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TPV: If you were to substitute for a class, what class would you substitute for?<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">DP: I wouldn\u2019t mind substituting \u2013 well I guess this is not just a one day babysit a class, say I had to fill in for two weeks \u2013 and they couldn\u2019t find anybody and they put me in there for some wacky reason. I guess I wouldn\u2019t mind substituting for an English class if they were working on a novel I found interesting. I remember I enjoyed most of the books I read in high school, so if there was a class reading <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1984<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or something, I think that would be interesting. I wouldn\u2019t want to grade their essays though. I barely want to grade math tests.\u00a0<\/span>","excerpt":"This week, The Paly Voice sat down with math teacher Dave Peters to learn about the X, Y and Zs of his job, his high school days and his Twitter aesthetic.
