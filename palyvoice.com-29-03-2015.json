The schedule shown emphasizes the importance of teen discussion and \"Empathy Hour\" to the success of the event.

The Mitchell Park Library has also demonstrated support for this initiative through its \"Wake Up Call: The Role of Sleep and Teen Health\" panel on teen sleep, which brought doctors and educators, including Associate Superintendent Charles Young together to spread awareness of sleep deprivation in Palo Alto\u2019s youth.\r\n\r\nFollowing the recent suicides in the Palo Alto community, Gunn High School sophomore Martha Cabot and former teacher Marc Vicenti started the campaign, \"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.savethe2008.com\/\">Save the 2,008,<\/a>\"\u00a0to engage the community with its\u00a0six goals to decrease academic stress at Gunn, which includes assigning a less rigorous workload, having smaller class sizes and prohibiting cell phone use on campus.\r\n\r\nLocal professional publications like Palo Alto Online have shared anonymous stories of a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.paloaltoonline.com\/news\/2015\/02\/20\/guest-opinion-living-proof-that-we-are-all-in-this-together\" target=\"_blank\">local teenager\u2019s experience<\/a> with depression and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.paloaltoonline.com\/square\/2015\/03\/25\/paly-school-board-rep-the-sorrows-of-young-palo-altans\" target=\"_blank\">guest opinions<\/a> of individuals who feel the community is not taking the right approach to improving mental health. These articles sparked heated debate on online forums like Town Square, though teenagers seem to prefer sharing their opinions through Facebook and Twitter.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #373e4d;\">Carlson hopes\u00a0attending the forum will help support the\u00a0students in her community who have trouble expressing their struggles even on these platforms.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #373e4d;\">\"People should feel like it is okay to discuss suicide, depression, student stress and other troubles openly,\" Carlson said. \"I hope that the forum will help to facilitate honest conversations about the things that often go unmentioned.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #373e4d; font-family: helvetica, arial, 'lucida grande', sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #f6f7f8;\">\u00a0<\/span>","excerpt":"The City of Palo Alto is hosting a youth forum to discuss improving community wellbeing and mental health this Friday at the Mitchell Park Community Center.","date":"2015-03-26 18:56:47","author":"Maya McNealis","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/1969252_888575711181000_3124481212575686117_n.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"8544":"bryn carlson","8611":"Community","40996":"depression","18368":"forum","40994":"in this together","37655":"mental health","27709":"mitchell park","40995":"patrick burt","9135":"suicide","40993":"teen forum"}},{"id":101487,"title":"Meet the quirky side of your ASB candidates","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/03\/26\/meet-the-quirky-side-of-your-asb-candidates\/","content":"<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Palo Alto High School's Associated Student Body elections are officially here, and if\u00a0you feel that you don't know enough about the executive candidates, never fear.
