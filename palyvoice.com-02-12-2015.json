We\u2019ve seen other schools and other ASB's do something similar. It\u2019s a sport that doesn\u2019t require a lot of practice or lots of setup and basically everybody can kick a ball.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording\u00a0to junior class vice president Natalie Maloney, free cocoa will be given to spectators.\r\n\r\nHall said that the goal of the kickball event was to increase inclusiveness among the student body.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe can also get a lot of people on the team,\u201d Hall said. \u201cOur goal is to be inclusive and let a lot of people play. So if you\u2019ve got 12 people out on the field, and you are rotating people in and out, you can get 20 or more people on a team. Then we can have 40-50 players for the day.\u201d\r\n\r\nJunior Declan Flanders also shared similar thoughts regarding the new activity.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s great that we are doing the kickball event because it includes all the classes and even gets the staff involved,\u201d Flanders said. \u201cIt\u2019s an inclusive event that doesn\u2019t require a lot of skill compared to flag football or softball.\u201d","excerpt":"Palo Alto High School\u2019s Associated Student Body will debut a new kickball event during lunch this Friday at the lacrosse field.

In addition, it [coding] builds on their [students] problem solving, critical thinking and creative skills.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Event organizers aim to make the \"Code Fest\"\u00a0a district wide event.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt is very exciting that we can organize the 'Code Fest' district-wide,\u201d Kolhatkar said. \u201cOur team includes teachers, a couple of administrators, parents and students from our elementary, middle and high school levels, making it a truly unified effort.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The \"Code Fest\" will overlay with the week-long \"Hour of Code,\" which is an event that was started by the nonprofit\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/code.org\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">code.org<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> three years ago to introduce computer science to students, according to Kolhatkar.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the event, high schoolers will learn how to apply computer science in various ways.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cHigh schoolers can expect mobile devices and a range of robots,\u201d Kolhatkar said. \u201cEach of which will be accompanied by a set of challenges for various abilities. They will get hands-on time with every tool that they are introduced to. Each session is 50 minutes so they can work through at least one challenge with people guiding them if needed.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event schedule will consist of three sessions during which students can experience some of 30 different areas of coding, ranging from iPads to robots, according to the \"Code Fest\" flyer.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1:00-1:25: Event Kick-Off<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1:30-2:25: Session 1<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2:30-3:25: Session 2 <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3:30-4:25: Session 3<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4:30-4:50: Closing <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though the \"Code Fest\" will not make students masters at computer science, organizers hope that students will walk away with more interest in the field. \u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe program will introduce students to coding and go further in-depth with those who already have a basic knowledge,\u201d Kolhatkar said. \u201cBecause one 50 minute session will not do justice to the range that is Computer Science, the hope is that everyone walks away with writing at least some lines of code, and with an excitement and eagerness to continue down the path, incorporating the skills into their lives.\u201d<\/span>","excerpt":"The Palo Alto Unified School District will be hosting its first free Code Fest for K-12 students as an introduction to coding from  1 to 5 p.m. on Dec. 12 at JLS Middle School.","date":"2015-12-01 10:43:23","author":"Will Zhou","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/Programming.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["code fest","computer science","java","pause"]},{"id":112463,"title":"Boys&#8217; water polo optimistic after disappointing finish to season","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/11\/30\/boys-water-polo-optimistic-after-disappointing-finish-to-season\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_112534\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/WaterPoloPractice1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-112534\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/WaterPoloPractice1.jpg\" alt=\"Junior Andrew Jozefov looks to pass during the a Vikings' practice.

Last year, the team exited the playoffs one stage earlier.\r\n\r\nJunior Jared Stanley said he thought that the team could have done better in the CCS playoffs.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe past season went very well, but we were hoping to get a little bit further in CCS,\u201d Stanley said. \u201cIt was disappointing to lose in the quarterfinals of CCS. It was also disappointing to not perform as we had expected to in the league tournament as we were hoping to play in the league final.\u201d\r\n\r\nJunior Andrew Jozefov said that a lack of focus from the team ultimately led to its loss.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe had a few dedicated guys who performed well this year,\u201d Jozefov said. \u201cWe didn't necessarily have everyone on the team working with the same mentality, which didn't exactly help the team.\u201d\r\n\r\nJozefov said that the Vikings will have high goals going into next season.\r\n\r\n\u201cNext year we plan on winning leagues and beating Gunn [High School] in league play,\u201d Jozefov said. \u201cHopefully we can earn a good seed for CCS and get a bye into the semis so we have a solid chance at making some good things happen against some of the top private schools.\u201d\r\n\r\nDespite losing eight seniors including Kevin Bowers, Justyn Cheung, Christian Laurence, Ryan Reed, Luke Coleman, Cameron Kahn and Winston Rosati, the Vikings are very optimistic for the future and believe they will have the experience necessary to do well in the CCS playoffs next year. According to Stanley, the team will have a majority of senior starters as there are many current juniors who can step up. However, even though the team will have enough experience, Stanley recognized the importance of the team's mentality.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe will have almost a full senior starting lineup next year and as a result hope to definitely be serious contenders for CCS finals,\" Stanley said. \"In order to do so we need to practice hard in the off season and treat every game like it's our last.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School boys' water polo team (12-13, 8-6) looks toward a fresh start next year after a disappointing end to its season.","date":"2015-11-30 20:50:12","author":"Chirag Akella","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/WaterPoloPractice.jpg","categories":["Sports","Spotlight","water polo"],"tags":["boys water polo","CCS","jozefov","stanley","vikings","water polo"]},{"id":112531,"title":"ASB Movie Night &#8220;Home Alone&#8221; is this Friday, Dec. 4 in the Media Arts Center","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/11\/30\/asb-movie-night-home-alone-is-this-friday-dec-4-in-the-media-arts-center\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2015-11-30 15:47:10","author":"Josh Yuen","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]},{"id":112529,"title":"ASB Kickball Game is this Friday, Dec. 4 during lunch","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/11\/30\/asb-kickball-game-is-this-friday-dec-4-during-lunch\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2015-11-30 15:45:39","author":"Josh Yuen","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]},{"id":112526,"title":"Choir Madrigal Feaste begins on Dec. 4 and runs through Dec. 6 at Jordan Middle School","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/11\/30\/choir-madrigal-feaste-begins-this-friday-dec-4-and-runs-through-sunday-dec-6-at-jordan-middle-school\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2015-11-30 15:42:08","author":"Josh Yuen","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]},{"id":112522,"title":"Fiery arts winter sale is this Friday, Dec. 4 and Saturday, Dec. 5, outside the tower building","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/11\/30\/fiery-arts-winter-sale-is-this-friday-dec-4-and-saturday-dec-5-outside-the-tower-building\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2015-11-30 15:35:25","author":"Josh Yuen","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]},{"id":112500,"title":"Advisory this week is for all sophomores and freshmen (individual meetings)","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/11\/30\/advisory-this-week-is-for-all-sophomores-and-freshmen-individual-meetings\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2015-11-30 11:53:50","author":"Josh Yuen","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]},{"id":112354,"title":"Season Preview: Girls&#8217; soccer hopes to continue success","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/11\/30\/season-preview-girls-soccer-hopes-to-continue-success\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_112355\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/MG_3002.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-112355\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/MG_3002.jpg\" alt=\"Senior Jacey Pederson dribbles the ball past a defender as the Vikings defeat Menlo Atherton 1-0 in the CCS quarterfinals last season.
