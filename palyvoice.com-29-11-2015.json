Famous monuments such as the Sydney Opera House, the statue of Christ the Redeemer and the World Trade Center lit up the colors of the <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tricolore<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Snapchat offered a temporary filter with the text \u201cPray for Paris,\u201d and Facebook gave its users the option to superimpose the French flag on their profile pictures.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The day after the attacks, I checked my Facebook feed and encountered a sea of red, white and blue; my Facebook friends had changed their profile pictures in an attempt to express their support for the nation of France. Feeling moved by this display of solidarity, I quickly decided to take up Facebook\u2019s offer and change my profile picture too.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, in the very moment I clicked post, a question occurred to me: Was there any value in what I just did?<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I tried to process the rationale\u00a0behind\u00a0my decision. Did I change my profile picture to raise awareness? Absolutely not. You\u2019d have to be living under a rock to not know this tragedy occurred. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Did I do it to console people in a time of grief? Well, if that was my objective, I wasn't sure if\u00a0seeing the French flag overlaid over Facebook profile pictures was of genuine solace to people intimately connected with France. To get\u00a0more\u00a0insight, I spoke with junior Emily Read, who lived in a small town outside of Paris for several years. She changed her Facebook profile picture to the \"Peace for Paris\" Eiffel Tower graphic that was widely popularized on social media in the aftermath of the tragedy.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cSeeing people\u2019s profile pictures and buildings across the world light up red, white and blue is nice because it\u2019s really uniting,\u201d Read said. \u201cWe can\u2019t really do anything actively about the attacks, but we can at least show our support.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Read did note that she was personally disappointed by the fact that Facebook had made it an option to overlay only the French flag, when there had been so many attacks in other parts of the world. However, she criticized some for perpetuating the notion that the attention directed toward the tragedy in France was excessive.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI did not like that some people negated the support toward Paris and said \u2018Why are we supporting Paris so much? We should be supporting the other places instead,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be neglecting our support toward Paris; we should be supporting everyone at the same time.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, perhaps the thorniest issue surrounding the social media movement is that these gestures are inherently Eurocentric. We had the option to display our support for France, but not for Lebanon, nor Syria nor any other nation that experienced tremendous tragedies that same day. Have people, perhaps inadvertently, espoused Western-centrism by making this display of solidarity?<\/span>\r\n\r\nEven if the gesture does come across as Western-centric, all the blame cannot be placed squarely on the individuals who adopted it. The reason that so many Americans sprung to change their profile pictures to the flag of France and not that of other nations is the result of years and years of close cultural ties with Europe, in tandem with minimal\u00a0media coverage in non-Western nations. I\u2019m not suggesting that we should shirk our obligations to be informed about world affairs\u00a0\u2014 rather, I\u2019m simply saying that this kind of social media mobilization in response to a tragedy in a\u00a0western European nation should not have been unexpected.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, I don\u2019t think that the outpouring of support\u00a0on social media in this manner was inherently ill-intentioned. It may come across as perfunctory and not all that useful \u2014 how is superimposing the French flag over our faces supposed to solve anything? \u2014 but there is, oddly enough, an element of pragmatism in such a gesture. It stems from the realization that we don\u2019t have the capability to solve the insidious problem at hand, but we can show our solidarity. And of course, social media is one of the most accessible platforms to display\u00a0that sentiment.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The French flag stunt\u00a0is simply the most recent manifestation of a\u00a0wide-spread cultural phenomenon \u2014 taking to social media to express support for causes that are morally resonant\u00a0but perhaps feel remote and intangible. We should be careful to avoid thinking that social media activity is the sole way we can\u00a0make a difference. I know that none of us are going to single-handedly stamp out terrorism, but we do have a role to play. We can, for example, combat the rampant Islamophobia and xenophobia\u00a0that is unfounded\u00a0and causes extremist organizations\u00a0to fester, while still\u00a0engaging in\u00a0meaningful dialogue about eradicating\u00a0terrorism. Furthermore, we can take it upon ourselves to become more informed citizens (perhaps all that entails is parsing over the World News section for a little bit longer).<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At some point,\u00a0the last traces of red, white and blue will disappear from our newsfeeds,\u00a0perhaps to be replaced by another social media crusade. There is some value to be found in such a\u00a0display, but it's\u00a0important that we are not deluded into thinking symbolism is\u00a0the only means by which we can effect change.\u00a0<\/span>","excerpt":"Social media gestures in the wake of tragedy may come across as perfunctory and not all that useful, but they, oddly enough, are rooted in pragmatism.

Storycorps is a non-profit organization dedicated to oral-based story telling. Those who participate in Storycorps record their life experiences that are then\u00a0transformed\u00a0into animations. It's Storycorps' goal to create videos that reflect the powerful, individual experiences of Americans across the country.\r\n\r\nThe Great Thanksgiving Listen gives\u00a0students a chance to interview an \u201celder\u201d and capture his or her life stories, according to librarian Rachel Kellerman. Afterwards, students are given the option to upload the finished animated videos to the United States Library of Congress.\r\n\r\nKellerman says she finds value in helping students participate in the nationwide project.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are such a diverse and interesting country and I have such a limited experience in this world that when I hear other people\u2019s stories it helps me to feel connected to my fellow citizens,\u201d Kellerman said. \u201cI also learn a lot about compassion and courage from listening to how people struggle and embrace life\u2019s challenges.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Kellerman, during the event, students are free to book an online time to record a story of the person they choose to listen to. StoryCorps has an app that is designed to help students create questions, take pictures with the storyteller and upload the clip. In order to download the app, students must have parent permission, according to Kellerman.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe Storycorps interview process only takes a couple of hours, and it can be very uplifting and memorable,\u201d Kellerman said.\r\n\r\nThe Paly library is providing more information for students who are interested in Storycorps.

When I first heard the term \u201ccultural appropriation\u201d without fully understanding the definition, I reflected back on my own life and anxiously wondered if these events had been innocuous exposures to different cultures or if I had been unknowingly appropriating cultures since my elementary school years. In reality, I had simply celebrated these festivities alongside my friends.\u00a0It's appropriate\u00a0to experience other\u00a0cultures, as long as individuals maintain and recognize the\u00a0meaning\u00a0to ethnic and racial groups.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently at Yale University, the <\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/11\/09\/nyregion\/yale-culturally-insensitive-halloween-costumes-free-speech.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intercultural Affairs Council reminded students<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to stay sensitive of other cultures when choosing Halloween costumes in preparation for the holiday.

While onlookers may view this as an overreaction, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@aaronzlewis\/what-s-really-going-on-at-yale-6bdbbeeb57a6\">Yale student Aaron Lewis wrote<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0that trivial Halloween costumes were not the basis of the students\u2019 protests, but rather the prolonged failure of Yale administration to combat racism on campus. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without a doubt, the issue of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/11\/12\/us\/racial-discrimination-protests-ignite-at-colleges-across-the-us.html\">racial discrimination is and has been prevalent at many universities<\/a>\u00a0throughout the United States, notably including the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/11\/12\/us\/university-of-missouri-protests.html?_r=0\">University of Missouri<\/a>,\u00a0where there were race-inspired death threats.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0Clearly, it is unacceptable for students and faculty to perpetuate others\u2019 discomfort through racist remarks or actions. Despite disagreeing with Christakis\u2019s overarching message, her email made me think about the expansive gray area between inappropriate exploitations of other cultures and the opportunity to explore various cultures to expand one's own\u00a0perspective.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of my first introductions to the term \u201ccultural appropriation\u201d was through actress Amandla Stenberg, who created a\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=O1KJRRSB_XA\">video to\u00a0promote awareness of the issue<\/a>\u00a0in African-American culture.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0Stenberg addresses the exploitation of cornrows, a practical hairstyle for African-Americans that has become\u00a0a fundamental component of their identity. As hip-hop, another part of African-American culture, became increasingly popular, many African-Americans' cultural markers\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">became adopted by a wider, predominantly white, society. Soon, celebrities and models of Caucasian descent sported the hairstyle, and transitively, African-American culture became a trend, one that\u00a0exists even at our own school. Before\u00a0Spirit Week during the theme selection process, many students viewed a <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/09\/04\/ban-on-junior-spirit-week-theme-idea-causes-uproar\/\">nominated Spirit Week theme of \u201cGold Chains<\/a>\"<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0as marginalizing a minority.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But should Eminem and Iggy Azalea not rap simply because they aren't African-American? If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, why is there such a loud uproar in defiance of these actions?<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The broader issue is not necessarily that people are experimenting with different cultures, but rather that gestures can often be interpreted as an ignorance of\u00a0the symbolic significance to a distinct group of people.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The United States is supposed to be a cultural melting pot; sharing ways of life\u00a0is an integral foundation of American culture itself. Jazz music, considered a classic American music genre, epitomizes the consolidation of many cultures. It originated in\u00a0New Orleans and has roots from all over the world, ranging from French and Italian opera to Caribbean and Mexican music. If this form of cultural diffusion had been mislabeled as cultural appropriation at that time, it could have hindered the\u00a0growth of\u00a0this treasured part of American culture. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, it is inappropriate to stereotype and trivialize ways of life. Furthermore, it is unacceptable to claim ownership over another culture's aspects. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However,\u00a0upon understanding the backstories, it should be\u00a0acceptable to celebrate alongside others. S<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">haring cultures is essential to expanding an individual\u2019s perspectives. Instead of quickly adopting the new trend and remaining oblivious to its historic meaning, celebrate and learn the significance of others\u2019 racial or religious celebrations and practices.\u00a0E<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">mbracing and adapting a component of another\u2019s culture based on a personal agreement with its baseline sentiments should not be reprimanded or branded as cultural appropriation. I can\u00a0celebrate the Christmas spirit with my friends to evoke joy and generosity in myself and others.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Racial tensions are and will continue to be the forefront struggle of civil rights. As society continues to evolve and change, cultural appropriation can be avoided through cultural education, either self-imposed or in school, and the conscious decision to embrace these cultures rather than to exploit them.<\/span>","excerpt":"Instead of quickly adopting the new trend and remaining oblivious to its historic meaning, celebrate and learn the significance of others\u2019 racial or religious celebrations and practices.

One major goal of the initiative is to replace any negative culture, such as bullying, suicide and substance abuse with the development of a more positive culture.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe don\u2019t talk about sadness, shock or trauma messaging, but rather hope, health and strength messaging,\u201d Frecceri said. \u201cWe can start to change the way that we talk about past failure and the way we talk about disappointment and struggle, to talking about how we bounced back.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to the <a href=\"https:\/\/sourcesofstrength.org\/discover\/history\/\" target=\"_blank\">Source of Strength website<\/a>, the initiative has spread to become a nationwide movement across the United States since its founding in a Native American reservation system in North Dakota in 1988 as a suicide prevention program. Sources of Strength has reduced the number of suicide attempts in other communities similar to that of Palo Alto, according to Frecceri.\r\n\r\n\u201cSources of Strength has been implemented in communities like ours where we\u2019ve had suicide contagion, and it\u2019s been shown to build protective factors in those communities,\u201d Frecceri said. \u201cWe live in a community here in Palo Alto where there is a certain culture of achievement. Success kind of looks one way. We have to change that narrative somehow and I think Sources of Strength is a good way for us to start that. It\u2019s not about being silent but it is about sharing the hope, the health, and the strength that we\u2019ve learned and used to come through hard times.\u201d\r\n\r\nInitially, staff nominated approximately 150 students to be part of the initiative's core members, but the group is now comprised of 68 students, along with 25 mentors who are Paly staff members. Members underwent a training session in October to understand what it takes to be a peer leader and learn about the variety of sources of strength that people rely on.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe asked teachers and staff across campus to send us a list of nominations of students in ninth, 10th, 11th and 12th grade that they thought were students who in their various social groups had a voice,\u201d Frecceri said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t say to send us a list of leaders or to send us a list of those traditional high-achieving students or popular students.\u201d\r\n\r\nTogether, mentors will work with students on two overarching campaigns. While mentors facilitate progress and provide the students with materials, students are mostly in charge of conducting the project. One campaign seeks to\u00a0identify and thank trusted adults on campus while the other is centered on gratitude. Sources of Strength students are divided into eight different groups with approximately eight students and three mentors who will focus on more specific subsets of the two main campaigns.\r\n\r\nSome of the groups will specialize in campaigning through social media, audio-visual means, presentations or event coordinating, according to Frecceri. Students meet twice a month\u00a0with their groups to help brainstorm, plan, execute and reflect on their campaigns.\r\n\r\n\u201cI'm the adviser for the audio-visual committee,\" said Sharla May, math teacher and a Sources of Strength adviser. \"They're dealing with audio aspects of the campaign. Currently, the members are trying to publicize their campaign through InFocus, Paly Radio or even the MAC [Media Arts Center] screens.\u201d\r\n\r\nPaly students will witness many of these campaigns implemented on campus this month.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe groups have been meeting since Oct. 12,\u201d Frecceri said. \u201cNow they\u2019re in the phase of implementation and in the week following Thanksgiving, you\u2019ll see a lot of these campaigns getting rolled out.\u201d\r\n\r\nJunior Zahra Muzaffar, a member of Sources of Strength, is one of six students who, along with the guidance of two mentors, has developed and launched a campaign this Monday. Her campaign is a mixture of both identifying trusted adults and sources of gratitude.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy group did the \u2018Have you been pinned?\u2019 campaign,\u201d Muzaffar said. \u201cWe started with 100 clothespins and wrote people messages. The idea was that they would keep their messages and pass it on to someone else. We also created a <a href=\"http:\/\/paly.io\/pinned\" target=\"_blank\">virtual board<\/a> that anyone can add to.\u201d\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sources of Strength member and junior Timothy Liu is working in another group on completing a school mural to spread messages of strength and gratitude.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWe're looking to create a mural that will allow students to contribute to it and add their own flair and feel so that at the end, we have a school mural in a sense,\u201d Liu said.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frecceri stresses that Sources of Strength is not a club, but an initiative whose long-term goal is to is to implement a positive, long-lasting culture of support.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cMy goal is that in a couple of years Paly will identify itself as a Sources of Strength school,\u201d Frecceri said. \"We all are responsible for coming around this. \u2026 It\u2019s going to be Paly and Gunn, together, united, doing this as a community.\u201d<\/span>","excerpt":"Sources of Strength, an initiative at Palo Alto and Gunn high schools, is organizing student-run campaigns in order for staff, students and parents to spread ideas of hope, health and strength.","date":"2015-11-19 11:02:38","author":"Adrienne Kwok","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/21.jpg","categories":["Features","News"],"tags":["bloom","brimhall","Frecceri","gunn","jonathan","josh","lauren","layla","leinhos","liu","muzaffar","nadia","new","nolen","of","paly","prevention","program","solatan","sources","strength","suicide","timothy","zahra"]},{"id":112108,"title":"Tuesday Tunes: James Franco","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/11\/17\/tuesday-tunes-james-franco\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_112135\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"347\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/franco.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-112135\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/franco.png\" alt=\"James Franco currently mentors high school students through his film workshop located in Palo Alto High School's Media Arts Center.

Franco recalls how music surrounded many of his school experiences.\r\n\r\n\u201cOne of my best friends was in a band called Smiley Face,\u201d Franco said. \"There were a lot of battles of the bands.\u201d\r\n\r\nOf the various bands that participated in battle of the bands, Franco recalls a female\u00a0band\u00a0to be his favorite.\r\n\r\n\u201cRaggedy Ann was the only female band,\u201d Franco said. \u201cThey were the biggest band to come out of all of them and they actually went on to become\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.the-donnas.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">The\u00a0Donnas<\/a>.\u201d\r\n\r\nFranco currently enjoys all types of music, but is\u00a0especially drawn to alternative music, much like his alternative work displayed in his art and short movies.\r\n\r\n\u201cI really enjoy listening to Motown, and I listen to a lot of Rolling Stones,\u201d Franco said. \u201cBut I have to admit, I currently really like all three of Justin Bieber\u2019s new singles.\u201d\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/embed.spotify.com\/?uri=spotify%3Auser%3Aethankao55%3Aplaylist%3A6tWPWBZi0IL7ojQF3KClZY\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\"><\/iframe>","excerpt":"The Paly Voice sat down with successful actor and Palo Alto High School graduate James Franco to discuss how music influenced his Paly experience and career.","date":"2015-11-17 20:53:31","author":"Ethan Kao","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/Screen-Shot-2015-11-17-at-8.54.26-PM.png","categories":["Tuesday Tunes"],"tags":["famous","film workshop","james","james franco","the interview","tuesday","Tuesday Tunes","tunes"]}]
