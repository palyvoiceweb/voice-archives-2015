Water polo is currently practicing at Rengstorff Park but will move to Gunn's pool in the coming weeks. According to volleyball head coach Jekira Wilson, the team will practice and play games in Gunn's old gym during the 2015 season.\r\n\r\nWilson said she took several days to complete the transition, ensuring that\u00a0the equipment was properly labeled and ready for transportation.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe change in location has only affected me in the sense of making sure all three teams [freshman, junior varsity and varsity] are all organized and getting to Gunn on time for practices and eventually matches,\u201d Wilson said.\r\n\r\nDue to the commute often taking upwards of 20 minutes to get to practice, Wilson's largest concern is giving players enough time to get their homework done.\r\n\r\nJunior volleyball setter Jessica Lee also agreed that having to travel across town is one of the biggest difficulties.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe location is a pain to get to every day,\" Lee said. \"You have to allow 30 minutes to get there every time.\"\r\n\r\nDespite disliking the relocation, Lee stays positive about the new gym construction.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate, but it\u2019s for the better for Paly athletics so we are paying it forward,\u201d Lee said.\r\n\r\nAnother major concern for Wilson is getting enough Paly \u00a0fans to attend home games.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe the move will affect the players' performance,\" Wilson said. \"I do encourage Paly student's however, to make it out to games\u2014 the girls will need the support.\u201d\r\n\r\nPaly Volleyball is not the only fall sport being affected by the gym construction. Water polo will is also facing \u00a0the challenges of no longer having a pool on campus.\r\n\r\nMuch like Lee, junior water polo player Alex Beaudry is also being affected time wise by the move to a new location.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe change allows for no procrastination,\" Beaudry said. \"Since practice is right after school and ends at around 6 p.m., there are no big blocks for me to do homework in.\"\r\n\r\nSome winter and spring sports including basketball, wrestling and badminton. will also have to move off campus during their respective seasons.\r\n\r\nOther than changes in location, Paly sports teams are settling into their groove. \"Gunn has been very accommodating and other than the giant \"G\" on the wall and the change in paint colors, we are very much making ourselves at home,\" Wilson said.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"Palo Alto High School's students, staff, coaches and parents are facing challenges brought on by recent construction projects, including the Big Gym's renovations and the pool's closure, which have caused many sports teams to relocate off-campus.\r\n","date":"2015-09-01 11:34:16","author":"Jackson Doerr","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/11911387_1807124139514151_1611859663_n1.jpg","categories":["Sports","Spotlight"],"tags":{"32738":"alex beaudry","49942":"beaudry","11286":"big gym","12358":"coach","8616":"construction","8751":"gunn","49940":"jekira wilson","8944":"palo alto high school","8953":"paly","9863":"pool","49939":"rinconada","9120":"sports","41060":"teams","38450":"update","9216":"volleyball","49938":"waterpolov","49941":"wilson"}},{"id":106526,"title":"Minimum day scheduled for this Friday, Sept. 4 (12:20 p.m. dismissal time)","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/08\/31\/minimum-day-scheduled-for-this-friday-sept-4-1220-p-m-dismissal-time\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2015-08-31 18:38:41","author":"Josh Yuen","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]},{"id":106160,"title":"Palo Alto to raise minimum wage","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/08\/30\/palo-alto-to-raise-minimum-wage\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_106123\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"579\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/IMG_9928.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-106123\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/IMG_9928.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_9928\" width=\"579\" height=\"386\" \/><\/a> Community members watch as Palo Alto City Council members discuss raising the minimum wage from $9 to $11 per hour.

Photo by Emily Hwang.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nPalo Alto's minimum wage will increase from $9 to $11 per hour, effective Jan. 1, after a unanimous vote by the Palo Alto City Council on Aug. 24. The wage hike is part of a phased effort to set the minimum wage to $15 by 2018.\r\n\r\nThe decision came nearly four months after the Council\u2019s Policy and Services Committee approved a recommendation to increase the city\u2019s minimum wage, in light of\u00a0several neighboring cities\u2019 adoption of wage hikes.\r\n\r\nSeveral open-forum speakers emphatically advocated for a minimum wage hike, and rebutted the claim that an increase would be devastatingly detrimental to\u00a0businesses.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe dire predictions are wrong,\u201d said Paul George, director of the Peninsula Peace and Justice Center. \"We have an excellent real life example from San Jose ... in the food and hospitality industry, the number of jobs\u00a0increased.\"\r\n\r\nOthers implored\u00a0the council to vote for a\u00a0wage increase\u00a0as a means to combat ever-increasing income inequality.\r\n\r\n\"The rich get richer and the poor get poorer,\" said Andrew Boone, a member of East Palo Alto's Planning Committee. \"There\u2019s no reason not to do it [raise the minimum wage] that I can think of.\"\r\n\r\nA\u00a0few small business owners, however, urged the council to vote against the measure, explaining that\u00a0tip compensation, among other factors, are not considered as part of the current wage.\r\n\r\n\"The minimum wage can\u2019t be looked at as a simple minimum wage,\" Coupa Cafe owner Nancy Coupal said.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"326\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/IMG_9929.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-106124\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/IMG_9929.jpg\" alt=\"Nancy Coupal\" width=\"326\" height=\"217\" \/><\/a> Coupa Cafe owner Nancy Coupal speaks before the Palo Alto City Council on Aug. 24, insisting against a $2 minimum wage raise.

Though the council members were supportive of the wage hike, they expressed a desire to explore exceptions regarding\u00a0employee salaries. Councilman Greg Scharff commended the Committee\u2019s gradual approach to raising wages but believes that other wage\u00a0issues should be considered in future discourse.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe should amend the [exempt waitstaff] policy to get where we want to go,\" he said.\r\n\r\nCouncilman Cory Wolbach refuted the claim that teenage workers will be negatively impacted by the wage increase.\r\n\r\n\"'It will hurt teens because they won\u2019t be able to find jobs' is a claim not well supported by economic research,\" he said.\r\n\r\nMayor Karen Holman stated that the potential economic effects on teenagers\u00a0was factored into her decision.\r\n\r\nJunior Haley Chalmers, who works as a lifeguard, does not think the minimum wage increase will impact her job.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think it [the wage increase] is going to affect me, because I already have a job and I get paid more than the minimum wage that it's getting raised to,\" Chalmers said.\r\n\r\nHowever, Chalmers says she thinks the higher minimum wage might make it more difficult for unskilled teenagers without work experience to find jobs.\r\n\r\n\"It will be harder for companies to pay their employees,\" Chalmers said. \"They [businesses] are going to pick people with more experience over teenagers because there will be less job spaces.\"\r\n\r\nMatthew Glickman, a lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, believes that the raise will have a negligible effect on local businesses.\r\n\r\n\"The main thing that classic economics says is supply and demand \u2014 if you make something more expensive, people want less of it,\" Glickman said. \"But in practice, studies have shown that if it [the wage increase] is not a huge difference, not that many jobs disappear... so you probably won't see a big change here.\"","excerpt":"Palo Alto's minimum wage will increase from $9 to $11, effective Jan. 1, 2016, after a unanimous vote by the Palo Alto City Council on Aug. 24.

Photos by Tolbert Design Architects.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe construction project was initially slated to start in the summer of 2014. But, according to Berkson, it was continually delayed due to issues with the bureaucratic process.\r\n\r\n\"It [the entire construction process] is more than just a handshake,\" Berkson said. \"It's a leaseback \u2014 technically the construction company buys the property from us and then we get it back later. There's a lot of legal work to go through.\"\r\n\r\nThe architecture firm behind the highly anticipated new gym, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.tolbertdesignarchitects.com\/#!all-projects\/c1l7f\" target=\"_blank\">Tolbert Design Architects<\/a>, first presented its designs at a Palo Alto Unified School District Board of Education meeting in 2013. The state-of-the-art\u00a0sports complex will be U-shaped, featuring two connected multi-level gyms, a \"Hall of Fame\" corridor, several locker rooms, a concession stand, an athletic store, a dance and yoga room, a ticket booth and a wrestling room. According to Berkson, there may be some minor enhancements to the pool area, such as scoreboards or electrical outlets, but pool facilities will not undergo any major reconstruction.\r\n\r\nAccording to Berkson, assuming that there are no unforeseen changes, the parking lot off of Churchill Avenue will\u00a0remain\u00a0at its\u00a0current parking space\u00a0capacity. It is even possible that several spots by the East side of the gym may open up once it is torn down, Berkson said.\r\n\r\nAlthough it may not look like it from the outside, construction plans are already well underway\u00a0inside the gym. According to Berkson, the construction team disassembled the gym floor, so that pieces of it could be sold at a fundraiser hosted by the Paly Sports Boosters. Also, a HazMat [Hazardous Materials] crew has already removed any hazardous materials from inside the gym, Berkson said.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_106468\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"298\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/MG_8139-cropped.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-106468\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/MG_8139-cropped.jpg\" alt=\"Construction workers work on the water pipes near the Big Gym on Friday afternoon.

Photo by Yui Sasajima.[\/caption]The film is a \u201cquasi-documentary,\u201d intertwining a mix of fiction and nonfiction elements, according to Leong.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt gives a backstory of what happened last year,\u201d Leong said. \u201cIt then moves on to what we can do moving forward about the issue while also giving a fictional storyline.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe narrative aspect of the documentary tells the story of a fabricated high school student, \u201cWinston,\u201d played by Paly senior Daniel Cottrell. According to Baer, the character\u2019s setting and personal life remain vague in order to illustrate a relatable character experiencing something difficult.\r\n\r\n\u201cHis\u00a0[Winston's]\u00a0purpose is to provide the emotional aspect of the film that you can\u2019t really get through the documentary,\u201d Baer said.\r\n\r\nThe nonfictional component of the film contains interviews with students, teachers and mental health professionals. Seniors Carolyn Walworth, Bryn Carlson and Leslie Garcia share their stories in each respective interview. Paly math teacher Herb Bocksnick and English teacher Shirley Tokheim voice their opinions as well.\r\n\r\nOther interviews include Supt. Max McGee; Chris Sturgeon, a youth pastor at Menlo Park Presbyterian Church; Dr. Shashank Joshi, a Stanford medical psychologist; and V<span style=\"color: #373e4d;\">assi Johri, D<\/span>irector of health and wellness at\u00a0REACH Ashland Youth Center in San Leandro, which offers support services for teenagers.\r\n\r\nFor the team, the interviews not only provided strong components to the documentary but also added to the filmmakers\u2019 understanding of the topic as a whole.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe whole interview process was also a learning process,\u201d Baer said.\r\n\r\nAccording to Leong, the most difficult aspect of the interviews was dealing with the sensitivity of the topic.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou really have to be careful in the wording when you reach out to different interviewees and as a team,\u201d\u00a0Leong said.\r\n\r\nTo ensure consideration, the filmmakers carefully followed the standardized requirements for filmmaking provided by the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.afsp.org\/\">American Foundation for Suicide Prevention<\/a>, specifically in regards to word choice and glorification, according to Leong.\r\n\r\nThe documentary also cites information, ranging from teenage involvement in community issues to sources of stress,\u00a0that was gathered\u00a0from local high school students through online surveys composed by the filmmakers. Open-ended questions included:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Which of the following causes you stress?<\/li>\r\n\t<li>What is your definition of hope?<\/li>\r\n\t<li>What do you suggest the district do to support teen voice?<\/li>\r\n\t<li>Is teen voice being heard in the community?<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\u201cWe really valued the data because we thought it could give a good sample size of what people in our class really thought of the issue,\u201d Leong said.\r\n\r\nPrior to the creation of \u201cUnmasked,\u201d directors Leong and Baer had separate experiences with filmmaking. Leong took video production courses at Paly and attended a two-week course at Occidental College\u00a0for its School of Creative and Performing Arts. Baer, on the other hand, gained his film expertise through his father, who is involved with\u00a0the filmmaking industry.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust making movies for fun has been something I\u2019ve done,\u201d Baer said.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_106326\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"633\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/11143417_1610557845868209_4430432207647122128_n.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-106326\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/11143417_1610557845868209_4430432207647122128_n.jpg\" alt=\"11143417_1610557845868209_4430432207647122128_n\" width=\"633\" height=\"356\" \/><\/a> Senior Daniel Cottrell plays the role of \"Winston,\" a teenage boy struggling with depression who appears in the fictional part of the documentary.
