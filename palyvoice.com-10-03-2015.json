Why should I care? Why should I run?\"\r\n\r\nThis year is my first on ASB as junior class president, and as election season approaches, I've begun reflecting\u00a0on my year on ASB and have realized that more students should try to experience ASB.\r\n\r\nThe Associated Student Body is a group of around\u00a020 elected and appointed student officers who are responsible for representing the student body and putting on events like Spirit Week, dances and movie nights.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_100666\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"388\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/photo-2.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-100666\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/photo-2.jpg\" alt=\"photo-2\" width=\"388\" height=\"291\" \/><\/a> ASB members meet during the third period class Student Government to plan events. Photo by William Zhou.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nFrom an outside perspective, ASB may seem suitable to only certain types of students: Those who love dances, who are exceptionally\u00a0social and who are the most spirited.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am none of the above.\r\n\r\nWhile those students will certainly be comfortable, they\u2019re not the only ones who will be able to thrive in ASB.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m personally not extremely sociable nor spirited, nor have I ever been to a school dance until this year when I was on ASB and helped organize one. Yet I still feel welcome and have since found my place within ASB because of the wide range of topics and events that ASB covers.\r\n\r\nI\u00a0especially enjoyed the events and projects, which\u00a0varied from meeting\u00a0with Principal Kim Diorio to discuss stress, to voting on parking costs, to discussing the morality of a Sadie's dance and to planning lunch-time activities.\r\n\r\n\"If they [students] want to contribute to this school in a tangible way, there's no other organization on campus that's as involved [as ASB],\" Student Activities Director, and Adviser for ASB,\u00a0Matthew Hall told me.\r\n\r\nIn addition, there\u2019s freedom to pursue your own passions.\u00a0People will oftentimes bring their ideas to class, and the rest of the group will help execute them. This year, I wanted to increase communication between ASB and the student body with suggestions boxes, so I brought the idea to the class. Thus,\u00a0\"Advice for ASB\" was born.\r\n\r\nEvery perspective, that of an athlete, that of someone with a part-time job or that of someone who likes math, and every skill, whether it be a special talent or an ability to make flyers and videos, is valued. For example, even though I wasn't able to contribute much in the yelling portion of Spirit Week, I worked behind the scenes, organizing practices and creating publicity videos. Since ASB is involved in such a diverse activities, there\u2019s going to be at least one activity you\u2019re uncomfortable with; however, uneasiness often brings new\u00a0opportunities for growth. For me, that was Spirit Week since I hadn't really been involved prior to this year. Going through the processes, I discovered that I had learned how to work with others better, plan more efficiently, become more confident in myself and meet both students and adults that I otherwise would never have met.\r\n\r\nThe worst thing that can happen from running for a position is a loss and a couple days of being upset.\r\n\r\n\"The only regret I have regarding ASB is waiting until senior year to be a\u00a0part\u00a0of it,\" Senior Class Vice President Olivia Scola said. \"I love being apart of ASB and strongly advise people to run. If I could re-do high school, I would have run every year.\"\r\n\r\nThe potentials to make a difference and to grow as a person certainly\u00a0outweigh the negatives of\u00a0running for a position.\r\n\r\n\"Before I ran, I was unsure and hesitant of running,\" Senior Class President Maya Ben Efraim said. \"Consider this your push to run, its been the best experience.\"\r\n\r\nElection application forms can be<a href=\"https:\/\/sites.google.com\/site\/pahsasb\/\"> found online<\/a> or at the <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/02\/27\/asb-releases-election-packets\/\">SAO and are due on March 11.\u00a0<\/a>While forms for appointed positions will be posted later.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"When students walk around the Palo Alto High School campus, they may notice the yellow posters that read \"Become an 'ASBbae'\" and think, \"What is ASB?

As a result, juniors Andrew Cho, Daniel Sing and sophomore Alex Liang chose to swim with PASA instead.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #373e4d;\">\"I've been swimming for PASA\u00a0for nine years now and if I had to choose Paly or club, PASA\u00a0would always be my first commitment,\" Liang said. \"PASA has made me the swimmer I am today.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\nDrover said that the last season was great for Paly boys' swimming, as no other team in several decades\u00a0came as close to beating Bellarmine for the Central Coast Section\u00a0title.\r\n\r\n\u201cDue to the PASA conflict, the boys\u2019 swimming\u2019s primary goal this year has been changed ... from a CCS title to now focusing on defending our league title and maintaining our streak,\u201d Drover said.\r\n\r\nAccording to Drover, key swimmers to look out for this season will be seniors Winston Wang, Winston Wang (there are\u00a0two), junior Robert Cheng, senior William Shin and senior Ryan Drover.\r\n\r\nDrover said that even though the team lost a lot of its top swimmers and does not have much depth as last year, the team\u00a0will make it up by training hard and having the boys\u00a0step up.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #373e4d;\">The meet at Gunn next week will be by far one of the\u00a0hardest meets of the season, as Gunn\u00a0has the swimmers who have a good shot against Paly\u00a0in dual meet scoring, according to Drover.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #373e4d;\">\"I believe that it will be a good and close meet,\" Drover said.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\nAlthough the boys\u2019 team will suffer from major losses due to\u00a0the PASA conflict, the girls\u2019 team remains undeterred and hopes to do better this season.\r\n\r\nWith only one senior this year, girl's captain Sarah Putulin, and key swimmers freshmen Zoe Lusk, Peyton Wang, sophomores Haley Chalmers, Grace Zhao, and juniors Kayleigh Svensson, Katie Francis, the team hopes to place and win in both Leagues and CCS.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #373e4d;\">According to Putulin, the team did very\u00a0well last year, placing\u00a0eighth\u00a0at CCS and second\u00a0at Leagues.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cOur goals for the team this year are to win Leagues and place in top three\u00a0at CCS,\u201d Putulin said. \u201c I have no doubt that we'll kick butt at the dual meets.\u201d\r\n\r\nPutulin said that so far everyone on the team has great energy, even during \"crazy\" hardcore practices.\r\n\r\n\u201cI'm super excited for this young, fast team,\u201d Putulin said. \u201cBeing the only senior girl is a bit intimidating, but it's all good.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe boys\u2019 and girl\u2019s team\u2019s first league meet will be at 3:45 p.m. Thursday, March 12, at Gunn High School.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"Despite the major loss of key swimmers, the Palo Alto High School swimming team looks to rebuild this new season starting with its first league meet next week against Gunn High School.","date":"2015-03-08 22:22:17","author":"Daniel Li","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/Screen-Shot-2015-03-05-at-2.58.38-PM.png","categories":["Sports","Spotlight"],"tags":{"40108":"alex liang","15680":"andrew cho","11364":"andrew liang","8518":"Bellarmine","40106":"brittany nguyen","40104":"caroline moeser","8568":"CCS","40109":"daniel sing","40114":"grace zhao","8752":"gunn high school","40113":"haley chalmers","40107":"jayna wittenbrink","32733":"Junior varsity","40105":"karina goot","29696":"Katie Francis","40101":"kayleigh svensson","15411":"leagues","8944":"palo alto high school","40116":"palo alto high school swimming","8953":"paly","15610":"paly swimming","40115":"pasa","40111":"peyton wang","40118":"robert cheng","40102":"ryan drover","40100":"sarah putulin","9982":"scott powell","10017":"varisty","40110":"varisty swimming","40103":"william shin","15681":"willy lee","40117":"winston wang","40112":"zoe lusk"}},{"id":100083,"title":"Science Olympiad heads to regionals","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/03\/07\/science-olympiad-heads-to-regionals\/","content":"Palo Alto High School\u2019s Science Olympiad team will be competing at the regional Science Olympiad competition on March 14 at San Jose City College.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_100664\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"338\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/11015708_10205025921064956_871277614_o.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-100664\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/11015708_10205025921064956_871277614_o.jpg\" alt=\"11015708_10205025921064956_871277614_o\" width=\"338\" height=\"225\" \/><\/a> The Science Olympiad team is practicing for regionals on March 14.

Lab events involve \u00a0understanding whatever material is encompassed in the guidelines, but also being familiar with lab procedures.\u00a0Engineering events are events in which we build certain devices or objects, according to the rules of each event, that must accomplish a certain task on the day of the competition.\"\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\nThe team has been practicing since October, according to Lu.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe hold weekly meetings at one of our houses for the entire team so that we can study and prepare together,\u201d Lu said. \u201cMost of our preparation occurs outside of school, except for a few lab events. We're getting into the final stages of preparation.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe team has historically done well at regionals.\r\n\r\n\u201cPaly actually has two teams: Green Team and White Team,\u201d Lu said. \u201cGreen Team is generally the more competitive of the two and for the last several years has taken first in the region and first or second at States.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis year, the team hopes to qualify for Nationals.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe're hoping to not only maintain our performance in Regionals, but also perform better at the Norcal State competition, where we placed <a href=\"adam.stern*acterra.org\t\u2022%20Executive Director\t650-962-9876 x303 Alex Von Feldt alexv*acterra.org\t\u2022 Stewardship Program Director\t650-962-9876 x315 Amber De Buizer amberd*acterra.org\t\u2022 Development Director\t650-962-9876 x308 Ariane Erickson acterrabea*gmail.com\t\u2022 Business Environmental Awards Program Director\t650-561-4711 Avi Starr-Glass avi.starrglass*acterra.org\t\u2022 Stewardship Project Manager\t  Claire Elliott clairee*acterra.org\t\u2022 Stewardship Program Senior Ecologist\t650-962-9876 x311 Deanna Giuliano nursery*acterra.org\t\u2022 Native Plant Nursery Manager and Botanical Consultant\t650-949-3158 Erin Banks Rusby erin.rusby*acterra.org\t\u2022 Stewardship Program Restoration Specialist\t  Jade Burr jade.burr*acterra.org\t\u2022 Watershed Steward Project Member\t  Jeremy Merckling jeremy.merckling*acterra.org\t\u2022 Watershed Steward Project Member\t  Jessica Sanchez jessica.sanchez*acterra.org\t\u2022 Stewardship Program Project Manager\t650-962-9876 x305 Joanne McFarlin joannem*acterra.org\t\u2022 Stewardship Program Senior Ecologist\t  Judi Eichler judie*acterra.org\t\u2022 Communications and Creative Director\t  Junko Bryant junkob*acterra.org\t\u2022 Stewardship Program Watershed Program Manager\t650-962-9876 x347 Kristen Williams kristen.williams*acterra.org\t\u2022 Stewardship Program Restoration Specialist\t  Lucia Moser lucia.moser*acterra.org\t\u2022 Development Coordinator\t650-962-9876 x346 Michael Viramontes michael.viramontes*acterra.org\t\u2022 Stewardship Program Restoration Specialist\t  Missy Pinney missyp*acterra.org\t\u2022 Stewardship Program Project Director\t  Pat Martin patm*acterra.org\t\u2022 Information Services and Technical Support Specialist \u2014 Environmental Library\t650-962-9876 x306 Paul Heiple paulh*acterra.org\t\u2022 Stewardship Program Staff Botanist\t650-854-7125 Peter Neal nursery*acterra.org\t\u2022 Stewardship Program Nursery Associate\t650-949-3158 Sara Witt saraw*acterra.org\t\u2022 Stewardship Program Project Director\t650-962-9876 x354 Talia Kirschner taliak*acterra.org\t\u2022 Stewardship Program Project Director\t650-962-9876 x310 Vida Rohani vidar*acterra.org\t\u2022 Business Manager\t650-962-9876 x307 Zach Miller zach.miller*acterra.org\">second last year<\/a>,\u201d Lu said. \u201cIn 2013, we placed <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2013\/02\/25\/science-olympiad-team-to-compete-in-states\/\">first over Mira Loma<\/a> by one point at the State competition and became the first team from the Bay Area to qualify to Nationals, so we're hoping to do that again.\u201d\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"Palo Alto High School\u2019s Science Olympiad team will be competing at the regional Science Olympiad competition on March 14 at San Jose City College.","date":"2015-03-07 18:17:18","author":"Will Zhou","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/11015708_10205025921064956_871277614_o.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":{"9689":"#norcal","39735":"alex lu","8944":"palo alto high school","14166":"paly scioly","39734":"regional","9074":"science olympiad","10045":"scioly"}},{"id":100168,"title":"Students to perform in state-wide musical","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/03\/07\/students-to-perform-in-state-wide-musical\/","content":"Six Palo Alto High School students are set to perform in a state-wide production of \"Hello!

The students had to prepare a song and read scenes for the audition, Leinhos says. Twenty students in total from various parts of California were selected for the production, which is a part of the 2015 California State Thespian Festival.\r\n\r\nThe musical, set in New York City during the 1910s, follows two young couples involved in the developing pop music industry, according to Rohrbach. The show features music composed by George Gershwin, Irving Berlin and Jerome Kern.\r\n\r\n\"It [the plot] is an interesting web that gets spun,\u201d Rohrbach said.\r\n\r\nThe student\u00a0performers\u00a0must travel to Los Angeles to rehearse for three weekends in total. According to sophomore Jason Pollak, the rehearsals last about 14 hours each day. While a production would typically be rehearsed in two- to three-hour intervals, the producers of this show have condensed the rehearsal time because so much travel is required to rehearse.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe show is turning out pretty well so far, although a lot of work has been squeezed into maybe five\u00a0total days of rehearsal since the beginning of the project,\u201d Leinhos said.\r\n\r\nAccording to Pollak, the cast has one more rehearsal before performing and is now focused on making sure the show runs smoothly.\r\n\r\nRohrbach encourages anyone who will be in the Southern California area to come watch the play.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019ll turn out really well,\" Rohrbach said. \"It\u2019ll be well worth it in the end.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe show was created and written by Cheri Steinkellner, a Tony-nominated and Emmy-winning playwright who also wrote the popular musical \"Sister\u00a0Act.\"\r\n\r\nLeinhos says she wanted to be a part of the show because of Steinkellner's mindset.\r\n\r\n\u201cShe [Steinkellner] wants our generation to learn and enjoy the songs that gave kids hope and joy so long ago, and I think with us bringing the show to State Festival, we're on our way to helping achieve that goal for her,\u201d Leinhos said.\r\n\r\nCalifornia Thespians, a chapter of the Educational Theatre Association, is sponsoring the production, according to Rohrbach.","excerpt":"Six Palo Alto High School students are set to perform in a state-wide production of \"Hello!

The social media site with over 1.39 billion users introduced this new feature on Feb. 25 to\u00a0offer\u00a0support to\u00a0individuals dealing with depression. Screenshot by Alex Merkle-Raymond.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nIn this article, we discuss both the pros and cons of such a feature.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n\r\n<em>Student opinion:\u00a0<\/em>I think it's a good thing, because there are a lot of people who post statuses that\u00a0I don't feel comfortable commenting on, but I can tell something is going on,\" senior Jack Brook said. \"It's good that you can do this anonymously without feeling awkward.\"\r\n\r\n<strong>1. It's anonymous<\/strong>.\u00a0Many\u00a0Facebook users have hundreds of\u00a0Facebook friends, many of whom may simply be acquaintances.\u00a0However, the anonymity of this\u00a0notification allows all Facebook friends to reach out to those who may be in pain, regardless\u00a0of how close the two individuals are to one another.\r\n\r\n<strong>2.\u00a0<\/strong><strong>There are options.<\/strong>\u00a0The new service not only attempts to help the potentially suicidal individual, but it also offers help to the user who reports the post, because, according to Facebook, \"it's important for you to feel supported, too.\" Due to this belief,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0presents the user with the ability to reach out to a friend, chat with a trained helper or\u00a0even\u00a0find nearby counseling services.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. It shows you care.<\/strong>\u00a0It is initially a Facebook friend who voices a sign of concern to the potentially suicidal individual. When the suicidal person receives a Facebook notification stating that someone believes they are in distress, the notification has the ability to make\u00a0the\u00a0suicidal person feel loved and cared for.\r\n\r\n<strong>4. Difficult situations are placed in the hands of professionals.<\/strong>\u00a0Often, many friends and family members are simply not equipped to handle a suicidal situation and they may become overwhelmed. The tools Facebook provide, however, aim to direct suicidal individuals to trained resources and facilities that know how to properly handle such a situation.\r\n\r\n<strong>5. Better safe than sorry.\u00a0<\/strong>Is there really any harm in\u00a0reaching out\u00a0to someone who is potentially upset? Often people just want to know that they are not alone and\u00a0that they\u00a0have support. This notification service assists\u00a0in doing so.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n\r\n<em>Student opinion<\/em>: \"It's a terrible thing,\" sophomore Johnny Rohrbach said. \"It's a complete invasion of privacy. I think you should be able to express yourself freely without people recommending a psychiatrist to you. If you want help, you should be able to seek it out yourself.\"\r\n\r\n<strong>1. It can be abused.<\/strong> Just like any other feature on Facebook,\u00a0this feature could\u00a0easily be used as a joke. Any status could theoretically be\u00a0reviewed, soon turning\u00a0this feature as a new way to \"poke\" friends.\u00a0The service could be overwhelmed with\u00a0false\u00a0requests, making it easy for researchers to\u00a0overlook any real inquiries.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. It's an invasion of privacy.\u00a0<\/strong>Many see\u00a0Facebook as a personal space for\u00a0sharing\u00a0posts, photos and information to friends. Giving users\u00a0the ability to report a post, even if it is to be reviewed by professionals, is an invasion of privacy for those who want to keep their posts within their friend group. On top of this,\u00a0a professional who\u00a0knows nothing about the potentially suicidal individual shouldn't be allowed to deem a Facebook post suicidal if that person\u00a0has absolutely\u00a0no background on the individual.\r\n\r\n<b>3. It's limited.<\/b> This feature only works for people who post\u00a0<em>statuses.<\/em>\u00a0If someone posts a picture or shares a wall post, this same feature would\u00a0not be available.\r\n\r\n<strong>4. It is difficult to access.\u00a0<\/strong>To initially report a status, one must click on \"I don't like this post,\" then \"I think it shouldn't be on Facebook,\" then \"I think they might hurt themselves,\" and finally \"It's hurtful, threatening or suicidal.\" It takes many clicks to report such a post and it can often be difficult to decide which of the multiple choice options is most suitable for the post. The complexity of the reporting process may deter users from reporting potentially harmful posts.\r\n\r\n<b>5. It\u00a0can make people feel uncomfortable.<\/b>\u00a0Because some people utilize\u00a0Facebook as a public journal\u00a0or blog, there may be Facebook statuses with emotional\u00a0content.\u00a0Thus, some Facebook users may report these posts\u00a0as\u00a0a cry for help. The report may\u00a0offend the original Facebook user who simply wanted to record his or her\u00a0feelings. It may also lead them to change their posting behavior in the future.","excerpt":"This article discusses the pros and cons of a new Facebook feature, which seeks to share online resources for suicidal individuals, by allowing Facebook users to report a friend's post as \"hurtful, threatening or suicidal.\"","date":"2015-03-06 15:21:58","author":"Alex Merkle-Raymond","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/Screen-Shot-2015-02-26-at-1.31.19-PM.png","categories":["Editor's Pick","Opinion"],"tags":{"40127":"cons","8689":"Facebook","40123":"Facebook feature","40132":"facebook update","10751":"jack brook","34226":"johnny rohrbach","8944":"palo alto high school","8953":"paly","8964":"paly voice","9011":"prevention","40128":"privacy","40126":"pros","40125":"pros and cons","40129":"suicidal","9135":"suicide","9136":"Suicide prevention","40124":"university of washington","38450":"update"}},{"id":100774,"title":"No school on March 13","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/03\/05\/no-school-on-friday-march-13\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2015-03-05 21:45:31","author":"Lizzie Chun","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":{"40207":"b day","40205":"break","40206":"day off","32534":"holiday","33935":"schedule change"}},{"id":100651,"title":"Robotics team to compete at regional competition","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/03\/05\/robotics-team-to-compete-at-regional-competition\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_100723\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"378\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/11045754_1605464913003074_623212239_o.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-100723\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/11045754_1605464913003074_623212239_o.jpg\" alt=\"The Palo Alto High School robotics team completed constructing its robot last week.
