Photo by Alex Merkle-Raymond.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nWhile Diorio plans to notify parents of the new letter soon, she wants the first recipients of her email to be students in order to involve them more directly in the discussion about stress and mental health.\r\n\r\n\"Having listened to students all last week, there was a concern about feeling like,\u00a0'who's talking to the kids?'\" Diorio said. \"The adults are in this position where we're having a lot of adult conversations about suicide and stress, but who's talking to the kids, and how come they're not being included in these conversations?\"\r\n\r\nDiorio said she\u00a0will discuss possible solutions to help empower students and improve the school climate with the Associated Student Body this week.

McGee also advocated for a community-wide effort to support students in\u00a0all aspects of their well-being, stressing\u00a0that mental health issues are not just a \"school problem.\"\r\n\r\n\"These past two weeks, people have been anxious to understand why [the suicide happened], sometimes quick to blame and generally eager to share their solutions to what they believe the students\u2019 problems are,\" McGee said in his newsletter. \"While the reactions are understandable, it is time to come together as a collective community.\"\r\n\r\nWhile McGee acknowledges that academic stress is not the sole cause of suicide, he emphasizes that change can begin within the school system and urges parents and students to reduce competitiveness at school, underscoring the importance of learning for the sake of learning, not for grades.\r\n\r\n\"It is imperative we remember student health and connectedness do not have to come at the cost of high academic standards,\" McGee said. \"This [students'] sense of curiosity and desire to deepen and apply knowledge is consistent with our [the district's] vision and evidence that we are a community of learners who will be well-prepared for a fulfilling future. However, when students feel they should prize their grades over deeper learning, when the number of AP [Advanced Placement] and honors classes they take matters more than what they experience in these classes or when they are over-competitive with one another or obsessed with checking grades, unhealthy actions can follow. \"\r\n\r\nMcGee has also authorized\u00a0a number of projects to help support students at both high schools, such as conducting a course alignment review, requiring regular meetings with school counselors and advisers and beginning \"mindfulness training,\" in addition to the changes that Diorio hopes to make at Paly.\r\n\r\nMcGee said he hopes to increase the discussion as a community about student wellness.

People are crowding doorways and streaming out the front door, sitting down on the carpet next to the podium and ducking under glaring camera lenses. There is a feeling of informality so typical of Latin America that it seems to band the whole group together under the weight and tension that accompanies the event. The event begins with a series of presentations, during which a father valiantly comes forward to share a few words with the group. We don't know the man any better than we know the rest of of the crowd, but we band together under his pain because his pain is our pain; his grief, the grief of all of Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis was a few months ago when I was attending a vigil at Stanford University at the Center for Latin American Studies to honor and inform people of the 43 missing students of Ayotzinapa, Guerrero. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.telesurtv.net\/english\/telesuragenda\/Justice-for-Ayotzinapa-20141014-0077.html\">According to South American television network teleSUR<\/a>, the students were arrested by Mexican police and then turned over to local drug gang Guerreros Unidos. When these students disappeared, a connection was drawn between the police who arrested them and the Mexican drug cartels. According to teleSUR, authorities believe that the students were killed.\r\n\r\nOccurrences similar to this massacre have become common over the last 10 years in Mexico\u2019s drug war. However, this event has brought to light a connection between the Mexican government and drug cartels, serving as a wake-up call for not only Mexicans but also for people all over the world. Mexicans and non-Mexicans alike are saying \u201cbasta\u201d or \u201cno more\u201d to the death, the corruption, the disappearances and the abuse of power the Mexican government seems to wield.\r\n\r\nThe reaction to the disappearance of these students has exploded into a movement for social change across Mexico and the world, rallied by students of all ethnic backgrounds against the corruption of the Mexican government and its increasingly translucent connection with the Mexican drug cartels. Since the disappearances of the students in Ayotzinapa, there have been hundreds of non-violent protests all over Latin America, many of them still ongoing today.\r\n\r\nMore than 100 people attended the Stanford vigil, Hispanic and non-Hispanic alike. I was glad to finally see people in my community act. Being from Mexico, the Mexican drug war has always been an issue prominent in my life, and the overwhelming support from the Bay Area community was something I had yet to experience. I felt very moved and empowered by the event.\r\n\r\nIt's disappointing how little American news channels have covered the events in Ayotzinapa. At school, I was surprised by the fact I was one of the few people who knew about the tragedy and the movement for social change. It makes sense, coming from Mexico, that I be informed on this topic; however, it doesn't meant that everyone else in Palo Alto should be oblivious to a tragedy that is happening right next door, in a country whose border we share. After asking around, I was also surprised by our community's lack of education on the Mexican drug war in general and other drug wars happening all over Latin America\r\n\r\nThirty-eight percent of California's population is Latino, and towns in the Bay Area such as Redwood City and East Palo Alto have huge Latino communities. Yet, there is a profound disconnect between the United States and Mexico. Violence in Mexico is not really highlighted by the media, and as a result, the few times that these issues are discussed, it is often in blind ignorance. Perhaps this is caused by the distraction of events in the Middle East. Perhaps people believe it does not affect them, or perhaps the fact that violence is happening a road trip away makes them feel uncomfortable and vulnerable.\r\n\r\nRegardless of the reason, violence in Mexico is not often covered by American media. Real violence by real people in a very real proximity to the United States is often left ignored, and what doesn't appear on the screens or in the papers ceases to exist in the minds of the American people.\r\n\r\nThis has to change because these events affect more than just the families of the those 43 missing Ayotzinapa students. They affect your gardener, the guy who bags your groceries at Safeway, your doctor, that student who sits next to you in class, your nanny.\r\n\r\nWe should address these issues not as far off problems, but as issues deserving of our attention that affect us in in California, right here and right now, even if they're not highlighted by the media. We should give our Mexican neighbors the global support they deserve.","excerpt":"Staff writer Emilia Diaz-Magaloni shares her opinion on the absence of coverage on Mexican violence and protests in American media.
