According to choir teacher Michael Najar, the construction is going according to plans. At the current pace of construction, the Performing Arts Center should open March 2016, according to Najar.\r\n\r\nAccording to Najar, the school recently received news that many small additional parts to improve the quality of the building will be paid for by the district. These parts include and an automatic platform lift, special lighting, an automatic orchestra lift and extra movable seats.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey will give the extra pizzazz that makes the building special,\u201d Najar said.\r\n\r\nThe Performing Arts Center will<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/01\/23\/added-construction-delays-expenses-for-new-arts-and-athletic-facilities\/\"> still need to fundraise<\/a> for programmatic equipment such as microphones and a piano, according to Najar.\r\n\r\nAccording to Assistant Principal Jerry Berkson, who oversees facilities and budget, the structure currently visible is part of the fly, which is used for storing and changing the background sets on stage. Berkson added that the plumbing for the building is close to completion.\r\n\r\nOther changes to the area include a city-planned removal of the old crosswalk, which <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2013\/10\/01\/construction-to-alter-campus-bike-and-car-parking\/\">connects Paly to Town and Country<\/a>; however, \"there will be some sort of path,\u201d Berkson said.\r\n\r\n<b>Athletic facilities<\/b>\r\n\r\nVisible action has yet to be taken on the demolition of the Big Gym, which was <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/01\/23\/added-construction-delays-expenses-for-new-arts-and-athletic-facilities\/\">initially scheduled to be demolished last May<\/a>. However, according to Berkson, plans for construction of the new Gym are in their last stage of approval by the state. According to Berkson, the next stage in the process involves receiving bids from subcontractors.\r\n\r\n\u201cOnce the plans get approved, the contractor will get bids from subcontractors, and the remodeling will be on the way,\u201d Berkson said.\r\n\r\nAfter almost a year of delay, the 18-month-long project is slotted to begin this summer, according to Berkson.\r\n\r\n<b>Library<\/b>\r\n\r\nPlans for remodeling the Library are on the way as the librarians push for their turn at a new building.\r\n\r\nDuring the construction, the Library will be moving to the Student Center, according Paly librarian Sima Thomas.\r\n\r\n\u201dIf all goes as we hope, demolition of the current Library will start at the beginning of summer and be moved into the Student Center by next school year,\" Thomas said.\r\n\r\nAccording to Thomas, the new Library plans to include the guidance department, student services, a mezzanine level for archives and high density storage, a place for the entire staff to meet, a classroom, digital lockers, reading spaces, a makers space and a computer lab. The librarians went to the Mitchell Park Library for inspiration and have decided to add study rooms similar to the group work rooms at the Mitchell Park Library, according to Thomas.\r\n\r\nAccording to Thomas, one of the main goals of the new Library is to change the ambiance from a walk-through and bustling hotspot to a destination set aside for reading and learning.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe [the Paly librarians] are hoping to turn the library into [a] visually more beautiful space but also promote a love of reading,\u201d Thomas said.\r\n\r\nThe high ceilings of the current building cause sound to travel and make the library less of a quiet space used for the purpose of relaxing, reading and studying, so Thomas says she hopes the new library designs will eliminate this problem.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe want the library to be much more of a heart of campus,\u201d Thomas said.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"Changes are quickly approaching for the Palo Alto High School campus, as plans for the Performing Arts Center, gym, library and science buildings develop.","date":"2015-02-17 19:57:40","author":"Emilia Diaz-Magaloni","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/10968139_798900016852755_582711681_n.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"9674":"athletic facilities","11893":"athletic facility","9955":"athletics facility","8520":"Berkson","11286":"big gym","8616":"construction","8690":"facilities","9954":"jerry berkson","8848":"Library","30526":"najar","11896":"new buildings","34383":"pac","8944":"palo alto high school","34382":"performing arts center"}},{"id":97164,"title":"Paly film students &#8220;Cinequest to success&#8221;","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/02\/17\/paly-film-students-cinequest-to-success\/","content":"Three short films produced by Palo Alto High School Video Production students will be screened\u00a0at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cinequest.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Cinequest Film Festival<\/a>, a\u00a0Silicon Valley-based event\u00a0designed to promote\u00a0creativity and technology.\r\n\r\nThe three short films accepted into the festival include\u00a0\"Eco-Man,\" by senior Jack Brook; \"What If You Slept,\" by sophomores Alec Cohen-Schisler and Ian Woodfill; and \"Where the Sidewalk Ends,\" by seniors Alex Merkle-Raymond and Maeve Lavelle.

What about Zoe?\r\n\r\n<strong>CT:<\/strong> She has a license. I really like that about her.\r\n\r\n<strong>PV:<\/strong> What's the craziest thing you guys have done together?\r\n\r\n<strong>ZT:<\/strong> One time, Cole and I were at this Harvard camp, and we pretended that we were twins from Britain. But then we met two actual twins from Britain.\r\n\r\n<strong>CT:<\/strong> That was really awkward.\r\n\r\n<strong>ZT:<\/strong> And they asked us what school we went to. We said The School of... Britain. And they said, \"Oh, that one!\"\r\n\r\n<strong>PV:<\/strong> What is it like attending the same school?\r\n\r\n<strong>ZT:<\/strong> It's nice.

I was really, really bored, because it's a 16-hour flight. I was chewing gum, and I wondered if I put gum in his hair if it would stick. So I took it out of my mouth and put it in Cole's hair. Then I tried to get it out, but it wouldn't come out. I was like \"...shoot,\" so then I just sat there. Eventually he woke up, and I was like, \"Oh my god! There's gum in your hair! How did that get there? That's so gross.\"\r\n\r\n<strong>CT:<\/strong> She tried to play it off like she didn't do it. I was like, \"You obviously did this....\"\r\n\r\n<strong>ZT:<\/strong> My mom was like, \"Cole, how did you get gum in your hair?\" and I was like, \"Wow! Gross! That's weird!\" So then we had to cut it out of Cole's hair. And that was when he had really long hair, so Cole had a huge patch with no hair. Let me tell you, gum sticks in your hair.\r\n\r\n<strong>PV:<\/strong> When did you find out it was Zoe?\r\n\r\n<strong>ZT:<\/strong> Right now.\r\n\r\n<strong>PV:<\/strong> What's your favorite story about Zoe?\r\n\r\n<strong>CT:<\/strong> One time, I was super frustrated at Zoe, and I was really young, so I did not have great anger management. I had a pencil in my hand, and she was really pissing me off. So I took the sharp end, and I just shoved it up her nose. I don't know how she didn't dodge it or anything. I just stabbed it up there, and I didn't even know what to do. She didn't even react that much.\r\n\r\n<strong>ZT:<\/strong> One time, I got a new belt for Christmas, and I ran around the house with Cole yelling, \"I'm gonna spank you!\"\r\n\r\n<strong>PV:<\/strong> Do you guys consider yourselves close?\r\n\r\n<strong>ZT:<\/strong> No.\r\n\r\n<strong>CT:<\/strong> Yeah.\r\n\r\n<strong>ZT:<\/strong> Squad!\r\n\r\n<strong>PV:<\/strong> What are you going to do when Zoe leaves for college?\r\n\r\n<strong>CT:<\/strong> Cry.\r\n\r\n<strong>ZT:<\/strong> Aw!\r\n\r\n<strong>PV:<\/strong> Any final words for the Paly community?\r\n\r\n<strong>ZT:<\/strong> 42 Wallabee Way, Sydney.\r\n\r\n<strong>CT:<\/strong> Shoutout to the Class of 2015!

If you have sufficient time, dedication and knowledge, then you can try pulling a Knope and provide your friends with bouquets of hand-crocheted flower pens; mosaic portraits of each of them made from the crushed bottles of their favorite diet sodas; gift certificates for facials; needlepoint pillows with their faces and the leading headlines from the newspapers on the days they were born on them; and personalized 5,000 word essays of why they're all so awesome. If your gift giving skills aren\u2019t quite up to par, though, never fear \u2013 any expression of your love and affection for your friends can be more important than material gifts.\r\n\r\nUltimately, we must remember that love is never exclusive to couples. There's no need to fall into a gloomy funk or secretly hate on those who are in relationships just because it's February. So, whenever February rolls around, instead of distressing and obsessing about your romantic relationship or lack thereof, choose to obsess about the gals and pals in your life who you care about most and who will never leave your side.\r\n\r\nAs Leslie Knope, the epitome of a workaholic, once said, \"We have to remember what's important in life: friends, waffles and work. Or waffles, friends, work. But work has to come third.\" While we agree that friends vs. waffles is an eternal debate, we encourage you to get a healthy dose of both by going out with your friends for some fantastic breakfast food and finding out for yourselves, as we plan to do.\r\n\r\nThe streamers and boxes of chocolates that you purchased for Valentine's Day will fade and likely pollute our planet, but the memories you make of waffles and laughter with your gals and pals will last forever.","excerpt":"Inspired by Galentine's Day from \u201cParks and Recreation,\u201d News Editor Lizzie Chun and Staff Writer Saba Moussavian propose a Feb. 13 tradition to pause in the time of Valentine\u2019s Day love with something they'd like to call \"Pal-entine's Day.\" ","date":"2015-02-12 22:51:15","author":"Lizzie Chun","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/Screen-Shot-2015-02-12-at-10.25.43-PM.png","categories":["Opinion"],"tags":{"31764":"appreciation","38784":"breakfast","38783":"brunch","38785":"friends","38649":"friendship","38646":"galentine's day","38647":"galentines","38781":"leslie knope","8927":"opinion","38780":"palentine's day","38648":"parks and rec","34605":"parks and recreation","11509":"valentine's","11508":"valentine's day","38782":"waffles"}},{"id":98549,"title":"Liveblog: Girls&#8217; soccer vs. Homestead","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/02\/12\/liveblog-girls-soccer-vs-homestead\/","content":"Check back at 3:30 p.m. for live updates as the Palo Alto High School Girl's soccer team (14-1, 8-1) takes on Homestead (6-6-3, 2-4-3) at home.\n\n[liveblog]","excerpt":"Check back at 3:30 p.m. for live updates as the Palo Alto High School Girl's soccer team (14-1, 8-1) takes on Homestead (6-6-3, 2-4-3) at home.","date":"2015-02-12 15:26:11","author":"Maddy Jones","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/IMG_0282.jpg","categories":["Sports","Uncategorized"],"tags":{"10198":"girls soccer","9087":"Senior Night","9110":"Soccer"}},{"id":97542,"title":"Paly juniors to compete in international math contest","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/02\/11\/paly-juniors-to-compete-in-international-math-contest\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_97747\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"418\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/math_award_students2.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-97747 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/math_award_students2.jpg\" alt=\"math_award_students2\" width=\"418\" height=\"314\" \/><\/a> Juniors Andrew Lee, Kathryn Li, Allison Zhang and Eric Foster pose for a picture after placing at the National High School Mathematical Contest in Modeling.

According to its <a href=\"http:\/\/www.comap.com\/about\/#b\" target=\"_blank\">website<\/a>, the contest's mission is to establish\u00a0learning environments where mathematical tools are used to investigate, model and explore real issues in the\u00a0world.\r\n\r\nHigh schools are given\u00a0two\u00a0problem sets, and the teams then set aside 36 hours within a\u00a0two\u00a0week period to work on them.\u00a0Competitors have freedom setting up the parameters of the problem and the\u00a0problems can therefore have\u00a0many\u00a0different correct answers.\r\n\r\nDespite the team\u2019s strong teamwork, victory did not come easily.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was very proud of our thorough research and our model,\u201d Li said. \u201cThe question itself was very open-ended, so we needed to make a lot of assumptions. Our model took the longest to make, and it was extremely satisfying to see that the numbers it produced made sense.\u201d\r\n\r\nLi looks forward to the international competition.\r\n\r\n\u201cFor the [international competition], our goals are just to try to find a novel way to use math to solve an everyday problem,\u201d Li said. \u201cWe also want to learn about different types of mathematical modeling and use them to help us solve problems.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe international contest will be at Paly in a math room yet to be determined, according to Lee, who added that competing teams will choose five consecutive days to compete between mid-April and mid-June.\r\n\r\nThe team\u00a0has chosen to compete from April 19 to 23.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe will try our best and be happy with the outcome,\u201d Zhang said. \u201cIt's already a great honor to be selected to represent the United States in the international competition.\u201d","excerpt":"Four Palo Alto High School juniors in BC Calculus will be representing the United States at the International Math Modeling contest this April after their victory in the 17th Annual National High School Mathematical Contest in Modeling last month.","date":"2015-02-11 12:37:00","author":"Daniel Li","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/math_award_students2.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":{"12848":"competition","8788":"International","8871":"math","38288":"math competition","38290":"math modeling contest","38289":"mathematics","8944":"palo alto high school","8953":"paly"}}]
