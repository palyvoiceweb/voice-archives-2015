The crime rate in Palo Alto is lower\u00a0than that of 80 percent of the cities in California, which gives Palo Alto an \u201cA+\u201d rating in the\u00a0AreaVibes\u00a0system. However, AreaVibes rates cities in comparison to each other, and despite acing the AreaVibes test, Palo Alto still isn\u2019t\u00a0perfect according to more local statistics.\r\n\r\nAccording to the City of Palo Alto website, there were a total of 332 burglaries in Palo Alto in 2012 and 242 burglaries in 2013. The chance of being a victim of a property crime, or burglary, in Palo Alto is 1 in 46, and precautions should still be taken.\r\n\r\nThe Paly Voice interviewed Lt. Perron of the Palo Alto Police Department to compile five tips for students to protect themselves against burglary, whether they\u2019re heading to practice or home alone for the weekend.\r\n\r\nListed below are five of Perron's tips to avoid a burglary:\r\n\r\n<b>1. Leave everything locked:<\/b>\r\n\r\nAlways lock your windows and doors. According to Perron, sometimes people leave doors unlocked because they assume Palo Alto is a safe community.\r\n\r\n\u201cNever leave a door or window open or unlocked,\u201d Perron wrote in an email interview. \u201cNo matter how hot it may be or how short of a time you may be gone.\" Perron said that the most common points of entry are often just \u201cdoors that people will leave unlocked or open, either intentionally, because they have a false sense of security living in a safe city like Palo Alto, or accidentally.\"\r\n\r\n<b>2. Pretend you are home:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPerron suggests turning on some music or the TV before leaving the house or leaving the lights on so that the potential burglar thinks someone is home.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey [the burglars] are looking for empty homes so they can break in, steal stuff real fast, and leave quickly with no chances of getting caught,\u201d Perron said.\r\n\r\n<b>3. Use just one headphone:<\/b>\r\n\r\nWhen home alone, avoid studying while listening to music with headphones on, as you might not hear\u00a0suspicious noises.\r\n\r\n<b>4. Beware the solicitor ruse:<\/b>\r\n\r\nThe most common trick burglars use when trying to find out if someone is home is pretending to be a solicitor, according to Perron. Even if you don\u2019t want to answer the door, talk to them through the door so they know someone\u2019s home.\r\n\r\n\u201cBurglars don\u2019t want confrontations, and they don\u2019t want witnesses,\u201d Perron said. Just knowing that someone is in the house is often enough of a deterrent for them.\r\n\r\n<b>5. Look out for your neighbors:<\/b>\r\n\r\nIf you see an unfamiliar car drive aimlessly down your street, or a stranger ring the doorbell of a neighbor\u2019s house and then walk around to the back, call the police. Chances are these are experienced burglars who are working their way through a neighborhood and may target your house next.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to learn more or have any questions, the Palo Alto Police Department has a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cityofpaloalto.org\/gov\/depts\/pol\/social_media_connections.asp\">media presence<\/a> on Twitter, Facebook, Nextdoor, Nixle, YouTube, Flickr and will be launching an Instagram later this year.

In this second installment of a three-part series, The Paly Voice features the youngest and least-experienced members of the Palo Alto High School varsity basketball teams: the freshmen.<\/em>\r\n\r\nRecently, The Paly Voice sat down with one of the two freshmen on this year's girls' basketball team, forward Sophie Frick, to talk about life at Paly, inspirational teammates and what it will take for the girls' team to finish strong.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_98904\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"616\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/IMG_8696.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-98904\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/IMG_8696.jpg\" alt=\"Freshman forward Sophie Frick warms up behind the three-point line prior to a game vs. Gunn earlier this season.

What's it like for you?\r\n\r\nSophie Frick: It's a really, really special experience, especially getting to play with the older players. You get to learn a ton from the upperclassmen, and even though there's not that many, the people that are older than me and Carly [Leong], we get to learn a lot from them.\r\n\r\nTPV: Speaking of the older players, out of all the other players on the team, who do you look up to most? Personality-wise and playing-wise?\r\n\r\nSF: I would pick Coco Lovely because she's a beast out there on the court, diving after every loose ball and looking for every drive and every rebound. Overall, she's such a happy person and always really positive \u2013 something I aspire to be like.\r\n\r\nTPV: What do you like about Coach Scott Peters as a mentor?\r\n\r\nSF: Coach Scott is very passionate about the game. You will not meet anybody who loves the game more than him and cares about all of us and the team more. He'll get us pizza after practice because we did well, and he teaches us stuff that I would not learn from any other coach.\r\n\r\nTPV: What do you like most about the high school experience thus far?\r\n\r\nSF: I honestly really like the different people and the overall environment and atmosphere at Paly. There's a lot of really positive people, teachers, staff and upperclassmen. New friends are great, as well.\r\n\r\nTPV: All right. What's the worst thing about the transition to high school?\r\n\r\nSF: I would probably say getting used to scheduling and time management. But I am learning and getting used to it.\r\n\r\nTPV: What's your individual goal for the rest of the season? What do you think about this team's potential? What does a team that has started so strong have to do to finish strong?\r\n\r\nSF: Our stretch goal is to win CCS [Central Coast Section],\u00a0without a doubt. My personal goal would be to continue to improve as a team player and pass to teammates that are open. Small things like that. We all want to finish strong.\r\n\r\nTPV: Is there an athlete in professional sports who you look up to? Kind of like Lovely, but someone more well known?\r\n\r\nSF: I don't think there's a particular athlete. I think it's more like a team play, like the San Francisco 49ers, even though they didn't do very well this year. In past years, however, their defense really works together and makes plays as a team.\r\n\r\nTPV: What does it mean to you to have Carly [Leong] on the team with you, as a fellow freshman going through the same experience?\r\n\r\nSF: Carly's like my No. 1 on the team. Being freshman buddies means getting the freshman treatment on the team, whether that's gathering loose balls [or]\u00a0stuff like that. But it's really nice to experience this great team and great season with her.\r\n\r\nTPV: What does Paly need to know about you for the future?\r\n\r\nSF: I'm ready for the next three years of basketball and other sports, as well. I hope to make a big difference in the athletics.\r\n\r\n<em>Frick and the girls' team is currently 22-2 overall, with an undefeated record of 12-0 in the De Anza League.\u00a0<\/em>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"In this second installment of a three-part series, staff writer Josh Yuen sits down with one of the two freshmen on this year's girls' team, forward Sophie Frick, to talk about life at Paly, inspirational teammates and what it will take for the girls' team to finish strong.","date":"2015-02-19 13:21:51","author":"Josh Yuen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/IMG_8696.jpg","categories":["Sports"],"tags":{"10098":"basketball","38661":"freshman basketball","8721":"freshmen","8735":"girls basketball","38660":"sophie frick","38967":"The fresh kids corner"}},{"id":97913,"title":"Mitchell Park Community Center to host teen trivia night","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/02\/19\/mitchell-park-community-center-to-host-teen-trivia-night\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_99057\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"560\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/1658533_367717013390203_3692188933849498793_o.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-99057 \" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/1658533_367717013390203_3692188933849498793_o.jpg\" alt=\"1658533_367717013390203_3692188933849498793_o\" width=\"560\" height=\"420\" \/><\/a> Teen Advisory Board members gather at the first meeting of the year.

According to choir teacher Michael Najar, the construction is going according to plans. At the current pace of construction, the Performing Arts Center should open March 2016, according to Najar.\r\n\r\nAccording to Najar, the school recently received news that many small additional parts to improve the quality of the building will be paid for by the district. These parts include and an automatic platform lift, special lighting, an automatic orchestra lift and extra movable seats.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey will give the extra pizzazz that makes the building special,\u201d Najar said.\r\n\r\nThe Performing Arts Center will<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/01\/23\/added-construction-delays-expenses-for-new-arts-and-athletic-facilities\/\"> still need to fundraise<\/a> for programmatic equipment such as microphones and a piano, according to Najar.\r\n\r\nAccording to Assistant Principal Jerry Berkson, who oversees facilities and budget, the structure currently visible is part of the fly, which is used for storing and changing the background sets on stage. Berkson added that the plumbing for the building is close to completion.\r\n\r\nOther changes to the area include a city-planned removal of the old crosswalk, which <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2013\/10\/01\/construction-to-alter-campus-bike-and-car-parking\/\">connects Paly to Town and Country<\/a>; however, \"there will be some sort of path,\u201d Berkson said.\r\n\r\n<b>Athletic facilities<\/b>\r\n\r\nVisible action has yet to be taken on the demolition of the Big Gym, which was <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2014\/01\/23\/added-construction-delays-expenses-for-new-arts-and-athletic-facilities\/\">initially scheduled to be demolished last May<\/a>.

It's a very comfortable bed. But not in a weird way \u2013 in a purely comfortable way.\r\n\r\n<strong>CT:<\/strong> Oh god.\r\n\r\n<strong>PV:<\/strong> Okay, Cole. What about Zoe?\r\n\r\n<strong>CT:<\/strong> She has a license. I really like that about her.\r\n\r\n<strong>PV:<\/strong> What's the craziest thing you guys have done together?\r\n\r\n<strong>ZT:<\/strong> One time, Cole and I were at this Harvard camp, and we pretended that we were twins from Britain. But then we met two actual twins from Britain.\r\n\r\n<strong>CT:<\/strong> That was really awkward.\r\n\r\n<strong>ZT:<\/strong> And they asked us what school we went to. We said The School of... Britain. And they said, \"Oh, that one!\"\r\n\r\n<strong>PV:<\/strong> What is it like attending the same school?\r\n\r\n<strong>ZT:<\/strong> It's nice. He brings me food a lot.\r\n\r\n<strong>CT:<\/strong> I get to sit on the Senior Deck sometimes.\r\n\r\n<strong>ZT:<\/strong> Twice.\r\n\r\n<strong>PV:<\/strong> What is one thing your sibling does that grosses you out?\r\n\r\n<strong>CT:<\/strong> Zoe does this thing where she throws up in her mouth sometimes.\r\n\r\n<strong>ZT:<\/strong> What! Cole used to dip his cantaloupe in ketchup. That was pretty nasty.\r\n\r\n<strong>PV:<\/strong> Which of the two of you would you consider more popular?\r\n\r\n<strong>CT:<\/strong> Zoe.\r\n\r\n<strong>ZT:<\/strong> Me.\r\n\r\n<strong>PV:<\/strong> What's your favorite story about each other?\r\n\r\n<strong>ZT:<\/strong> One time, we were on a plane ride to Africa. I was really, really bored, because it's a 16-hour flight. I was chewing gum, and I wondered if I put gum in his hair if it would stick. So I took it out of my mouth and put it in Cole's hair. Then I tried to get it out, but it wouldn't come out. I was like \"...shoot,\" so then I just sat there. Eventually he woke up, and I was like, \"Oh my god! There's gum in your hair! How did that get there? That's so gross.\"\r\n\r\n<strong>CT:<\/strong> She tried to play it off like she didn't do it. I was like, \"You obviously did this....\"\r\n\r\n<strong>ZT:<\/strong> My mom was like, \"Cole, how did you get gum in your hair?\" and I was like, \"Wow! Gross! That's weird!\" So then we had to cut it out of Cole's hair. And that was when he had really long hair, so Cole had a huge patch with no hair. Let me tell you, gum sticks in your hair.\r\n\r\n<strong>PV:<\/strong> When did you find out it was Zoe?\r\n\r\n<strong>ZT:<\/strong> Right now.\r\n\r\n<strong>PV:<\/strong> What's your favorite story about Zoe?\r\n\r\n<strong>CT:<\/strong> One time, I was super frustrated at Zoe, and I was really young, so I did not have great anger management. I had a pencil in my hand, and she was really pissing me off. So I took the sharp end, and I just shoved it up her nose. I don't know how she didn't dodge it or anything. I just stabbed it up there, and I didn't even know what to do. She didn't even react that much.\r\n\r\n<strong>ZT:<\/strong> One time, I got a new belt for Christmas, and I ran around the house with Cole yelling, \"I'm gonna spank you!\"\r\n\r\n<strong>PV:<\/strong> Do you guys consider yourselves close?\r\n\r\n<strong>ZT:<\/strong> No.\r\n\r\n<strong>CT:<\/strong> Yeah.\r\n\r\n<strong>ZT:<\/strong> Squad!\r\n\r\n<strong>PV:<\/strong> What are you going to do when Zoe leaves for college?\r\n\r\n<strong>CT:<\/strong> Cry.\r\n\r\n<strong>ZT:<\/strong> Aw!\r\n\r\n<strong>PV:<\/strong> Any final words for the Paly community?\r\n\r\n<strong>ZT:<\/strong> 42 Wallabee Way, Sydney.\r\n\r\n<strong>CT:<\/strong> Shoutout to the Class of 2015!
