With six departing seniors highlighted by pitcher Julia Saul and second baseman Hannah Bundy, second-year manager Bill Laskey, former San Francisco Giants, Montreal Expos and Cleveland Indians pitcher, will need this year's five seniors to step up to the plate in their absence.\r\n\r\nLike in previous years, this year's team captains consist of the seniors: first baseman\/outfielder Autumn Macareno, outfielder Julianna Heron, outfielder Maddy Jones, outfielder\/designated hitter Kabria Dame and pitcher\/infielder Casey Glassford.\r\n\r\n\"The goal of the team this season is to improve on what we did last year,\" assistant coach Mike Dutto said. \"We want to be better than just a little over .500 [record].\"\r\n\r\nDuring team tryouts, coaches made the decision to cut three senior players, one of whom was playing for the team last season. Dutto explained the move as a tough but necessary decision.\r\n\r\n\"We would like to keep everyone, but we can't if [the players] are just going to sit on the bench the whole time,\" Dutto said. \"We have a new program here, and we are developing our younger players, who need to play.\"\r\n\r\nSophomore third basemen Maggie Renteria praised Laskey's motivating influence.\r\n\r\n\"I like how he really pushes us to work hard,\" Renteria said. \"He is really motivating and focused on helping us. I think his number one priority is for everyone to be the best they can be and always play one hundred percent as a team.\"\r\n\r\nJunior second basemen Jesse Kim agreed with Renteria, emphasizing Laskey's dedication to his players.\r\n\r\n\"I like how he seems to be very dedicated and intent on improving everyone,\" Kim said.\r\n\r\nThe girls' first league game is at 4 p.m. on Wednesday, March 18 at Monta Vista High School.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School softball team (1-1, 0-0) is striving to improve drastically after last year's mediocre season, inspired by a manager stressing the importance of working hard.","date":"2015-03-04 17:47:40","author":"Josh Yuen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/11039358_10202463600030274_542839_n.jpg","categories":["Sports","Spotlight"],"tags":{"40096":"bill laskey","40095":"girls softball","40098":"jesse kim","40099":"maggie renteria","11391":"new season","8944":"palo alto high school","12045":"season preview","18372":"softball"}},{"id":99849,"title":"Boys&#8217; golf begins title defense with win over Homestead","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/03\/03\/boys-golf-begins-title-defense-with-win-over-homestead\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_100564\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"800\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/11024953_10206069050267994_1790611489_o.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-100564 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/11024953_10206069050267994_1790611489_o.jpg\" alt=\"11024953_10206069050267994_1790611489_o\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" \/><\/a> Senior captain Alex Hwang chips a shot from the sand trap.

Sophomore Hayden Libbey said the game was challenging, and required a strong effort.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was a pretty hard-fought game,\u201d Libbey said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have many players in total, so it was a lot of running for all of us.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith this win under the belt, head coach DJ Shelton predicts the team dynamic to change, as the team is no longer so senior-heavy.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was definitely a veteran group that had carried the program,\u201d Shelton said.\u00a0\u201cThis year, we have more of a complete team and it\u2019s a little bit more balanced in age. The kids seem to be less focused on hierarchy and more about development.\u201d\r\n\r\nSenior captain Zach Levitan also stressed that the team this year will be drastically different.\r\n\r\n\u201cOur whole defense has changed,\u201d Levitan said.\r\n\r\nJunior Matt Seligson echoed Levitan\u2019s sentiments, but emphasized that there are some up-and-coming players that will make an impact on the field.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe lost a lot of firepower this year,\u201d Seligson said. \u201c We\u2019ve got some promising talent in sophomores Hayden Libbey, who\u2019s been doing really well, and Christian Rider.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn addition to the younger players, this year\u2019s squad has several seasoned players that will be instrumental to Paly\u2019s success, according to Shelton.\r\n\r\n\u201c[Captains] Jon Rogers and Zach Levitan are just two of our outstanding players,\u201d Shelton said.\u00a0\u201c[Juniors] Matt Seligson, Cole Tierney, and Quintin Valenti are some other players to look out for.\u201d\r\n\r\nLast year the team finished 13-8 overall, 9-6 in league, and advanced to the semifinals of the SCVAL playoffs before being defeated by Menlo-Atherton High School. Now that fewer private schools, which have historically fielded strong lacrosse programs, are competing\u00a0with Paly in the De Anza league, Shelton believes that the team has a shot at winning the league title.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are looking to win league this year, and I think that\u2019s a reality,\u201d Shelton said. \u201cAll the private schools are gone, so while we play those teams, they\u2019re not in our league. League is becoming a very strong option for us.\u201d\r\n\r\nDespite the loss of the seniors\u00a0and a smaller roster, the team seems optimistic about its chances for success this season.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything that really stands in our way [of winning league], except ourselves,\u201d Shelton said.","excerpt":"Despite losing 14 seniors from last year, the Palo Alto High School boys\u2019 lacrosse team (1-0, 0-0) entertains high hopes for the upcoming season.","date":"2015-03-03 21:23:01","author":"Amy Leung","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/IMG_0003.jpg","categories":["Sports"],"tags":{"8491":"archbishop mitty","8537":"Boys","19371":"DJ Shelton","8836":"Lacrosse","9884":"league","8953":"paly","40097":"sacred heart prep","18834":"scvals","12045":"season preview","9090":"seniors"}},{"id":100468,"title":"Liveblog: Girls&#8217; soccer CCS semifinals vs. Santa Teresa","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/03\/03\/liveblog-girls-soccer-ccs-semifinals-vs-santa-teresa\/","content":"The Palo Alto High School girls' soccer team (16-2-1, 9-2-1) will be playing against Santa Teresa High School (15-6, 10-4) in the semifinals of the Cental Coast Section playoffs at 4:30 p.m. tomorrow at Palo Alto High School.

Although girls' wrestling is growing in numbers, only about three percent of high school wrestlers are girls. Sophomore Sara Aguilar and senior Alexa Austin are the two female\u00a0members of the Palo Alto High School wrestling\u00a0team. The girls compete this weekend at the California Interscholastic Federation girls' state tournament in Visalia. The Paly Voice sat down with the two female wrestlers to ask them about their wrestling experiences at Paly.\r\n\r\n<b>The Paly Voice: <\/b>How did you get interested in wrestling?<b>\u00a0<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>Sara Aguilar<\/b>: Well, I started because at JLS (Jane Lathrop Stanford Middle School), I had Physical Education with Coach Braumon Creighton. He asked me if I wanted to do it, and I just did because it seemed fun.\r\n\r\n<b>Alexa Austin:<\/b> For me, I also was in Mr. Creighton\u2019s class, and he wanted me to join. I thought I was too cool for wrestling, so I didn't. I actually played basketball freshmen year. Then, my mom and I started going to church, and my youth pastor was a wrestler, and he told me to join. I tried it just to try it and liked it, so I stayed.\r\n\r\n<b>TPV: <\/b>What would you suggest for other girls interested in wrestling?\r\n\r\n<b>SA<\/b>: Don't be afraid to try out even if you're the only girl. It is really fun, and you learn a lot. Mentally and physically, you grow.\r\n\r\n<b>AA<\/b>: It really is a fun sport. It might seem scary and intimidating, but it's a really welcoming team. Once you come out, we just like embrace each other.\r\n\r\n<b>TPV: <\/b>How much of a time commitment is it?\r\n\r\n<b>AA<\/b>: Practice is after school every day until 5:30 or 6 p.m. We don't really have any morning practices. Tournaments are on the weekends.\r\n\r\n<b>TPV: <\/b>How do you get on the team?\r\n\r\n<b>SA<\/b>: It's not a cut sport, so that means anyone can try out.\r\n\r\n<b>AA:<\/b> We start conditioning in September. Our first tournament is in December, so we just train for a few months.\r\n\r\n<b>TPV: <\/b>What's your favorite part about wrestling?\r\n\r\n<b>SA<\/b>: Being aggressive (laughs). It's just fun. You get obsessed with it sometimes.\r\n\r\n<b>AA<\/b>: I like competing. In a lot of tournaments, you compete with each other, but once the match is over, you become close friends. A lot of my toughest competitors, I train with a lot in the off season, and we are really close.\r\n\r\n<b>TPV: <\/b>What competitions are big for the girls' team?\r\n\r\n<b>AA<\/b>: A big one for the girls is Napa. Before girls' wrestling was part of the school, that was the state tournament, so we just keep going to it. We usually go to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sbhsd.k12.ca.us\/tournament\">Hollister Baler Bash<\/a>, which is very fun. Its a country tournament with hay bales and stuff like that. We always go to CSS (Central Coast Section) and State. We play in the dual meets, which is our school versus another school. Sometimes we do that in the league finals.\r\n\r\n<b>SA<\/b>: We also go to the boys' tournaments.\r\n\r\n<b>TPV: <\/b>Are there more girl wrestlers now than before?\r\n\r\n<b>AA<\/b>: Girls' wrestling is definitely growing and getting bigger. CCS is a lot bigger this year than it was last year, and it's been growing the three years we have been going. It grows \u2013 people get invited to come and just try it out.\r\n\r\n<em>The girls will attend the weekend-long CIF tournament this weekend at the Visalia Convention Center in Visalia.<\/em>","excerpt":"Sophomore Sara Aguilar and senior Alexa Austin are the two female members of the Palo Alto High School wrestling team.
