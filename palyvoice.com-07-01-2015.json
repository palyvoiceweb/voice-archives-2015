Both \u201cThe Hunger Games\u201d and \u201cCatching Fire\u201d are now available online. You can travel back into the arenas with Katniss and relive all of her adventures. Her kick-butt attitude combined with deep passion will make her feel like the best-friend-you-never-had. The emotional, action-driven storyline will keep you on your seat, perfect for a movie night with friends or family (or honestly, if we\u2019re being real here, a movie night with yourself). Read a review <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2013\/11\/21\/review-is-the-hunger-games-really-catching-fire\/\">here<\/a>.\r\n\r\n<i><i><\/i><\/i>2. \"Silver Linings Playbook\" (2012)\r\n\r\nIf you didn\u2019t get enough of Jennifer Lawrence from religiously watching \"The Hunger Games\" and \"Catching Fire\" from our first suggestion, this will be the perfect fix. A troubled Tiffany meets up with the equally messed up Pat, played by the easy-on-the-eyes Bradley Cooper, and embarks on a slightly off-beat journey to recovery. It\u2019s intense at times with a rough vocabulary and raw emotions. An unconventional friendship tip-toeing around a relationship will be a breath of fresh air for anyone who\u2019s tired of the typical Hollywood romance. Read a review <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2013\/02\/19\/review-silver-linings-playbook-deserves-gold\/\">here<\/a>.\r\n\r\n3. \"Safe Haven\" (2013)\r\n\r\nSometimes it\u2019s just a Nicholas Sparks kind of night. Indulge yourself in Katie (Julianne Hough) and Alex\u2019s (Josh Duhamel) peaceful life in coastal North Carolina. Coming out of an abusive relationship, Katie is reluctant to fall for widowed Alex, yet she adores his two young children, which brings them closer. All seems perfect until secrets from the past are unearthed. Following the classic Nicholas Sparks storyline with many twists and turns, \"Safe Haven\" will surely hold your attention and warm your heart.\r\n\r\n4. \"Titanic\" (1997)\r\n\r\nAlthough this movie predates students at Palo Alto High School, it is a perfect classic for the holiday season. Watch working-class Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) fall for aristocrat Rose (Kate Winslet) in the fictionalized story revolving around the R.M.S. Titanic tragedy in 1912. Watch Jack and Rose evade Rose\u2019s judgemental parents and evacuate the ship together. Although we all know that Jack dies from hypothermia while Rose survives by lying on a door (by the way Rose, there was totally room for two \u2013 scoot over), \"Titanic,\" whether you have watched it before or not, is the perfect catharsis for crying and eating ice cream on the couch after finals.\r\n\r\n5. \"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl\" (2003)\r\n\r\nWatching \"Black Pearl\" will bring you\u00a0back to the beginning of this amazing series by reminding us why this franchise is so fantastic: Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow is perfect, and the soundtrack is flawless (seriously, adding in that music to any situation automatically makes it 100 percent cooler). Following along with Sparrow on his adventures will keep you thoroughly entertained with his classic one-liners, swagger and winding exploits. You may find yourself developing a soft spot for this infamous pirate, even if you\u2019re really supposed to be pulling for Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) and Will (Orlando Bloom). While their romance is a nice side plot, Jack Sparrow is the true main act. It\u2019s perfect for a throwback Thursday over break and to get you pumped for the release of the next installment of the series, \"Dead Men Tell No Tales,\" due to come out in 2017 (don\u2019t worry if that sounds like forever, there are three other \"Pirates\" movies to keep you satisfied in between).\r\n\r\n<b>T.V.

Between Ross (David Schwimmer) and Rachel\u2019s (Jennifer Aniston) famous on-and-off relationship, flashbacks to Monica\u2019s (Courteney Cox) not-so-glamorous high school years, Joey\u2019s (Matt LeBlanc) comic relief, Chandler\u2019s (Matthew Perry) quirkiness and Phoebe\u2019s (Lisa Kudrow) singing, \"Friends\" will keep you laughing through winter break. Even if you have seen every single episode, indulge yourself by watching your favorite episodes or by watching 238.\r\n\r\n2. \u00a0\"How I Met Your Mother\"\u00a0(2005-2014)\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re looking for a modern comedy series, \"How I Met Your Mother\" is the show for you. Also set in New York, the series follows bachelor Ted Mosby (Josh Radnor) through flashbacks as he recounts to his children in 2030 how he met their mother. Marshall (Jason Segel) and Lily (Alyson Hannigan), Ted\u2019s best friends from college, unconditionally support him as they go from dating to married. Throughout the entire series Ted juggles his complicated relationship with TV news anchor Robin (Cobie Smulders) and often fights with his womanizing \u201cbest bro,\u201d Barney (Neil Patrick Harris). After the truly legendary finale that aired this March, all 77 hours (208 episodes) are available for your viewing pleasure.\r\n\r\n3. \"Gossip Girl\" (2007-2012)\r\n\r\nLook no further if you want to enter the lavish secret world of the Manhattan Upper East Side. \"Gossip Girl\" follows Selena (Blake Lively), Blair (Leighton Meester), Chuck (Ed Westwick), Nate (Chace Crawford) and Dan (Penn Badgley) from their last years of high school and through college as they navigate their complicated lives filled with money, lies and betrayal. Despite their internal group drama, they are the victims of an internet blogger, Gossip Girl. Ultimately, after six seasons, Gossip Girl is revealed. Voiced by Kristen Bell, each episode begins with Gossip Girl\u2019s famous slogan, \u201cGossip Girl here. Your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite. And who am I? That's one secret I'll never tell. You know you love me. xoxo, Gossip Girl.\u201d\r\n\r\n4. \"The Office\" (2005-2013)\r\n\r\nThe shenanigans of \"The Office\" could lift up anyone\u2019s spirit. Even though it ended nearly two years ago, you can still relive all of the glory days on Netflix over this holiday break. Steve Carell and Rainn Wilson will keep you laughing as you go through the mockumentary of \"The Office<i>.\"<\/i> It has something for everyone, with a variety of pranks and relationships (doesn\u2019t everyone just want to be like Jim and Pam). Perfect as an escape this break from boredom or any awkward relatives, you won\u2019t be able to stop smiling watching \"The Office.\"\r\n\r\n5. \"Parks and Recreation\" (2009-present)\r\n\r\nCurrently finishing up its final season, now is the perfect time to marathon all six seasons in anticipation for the last one. A rock-solid comedic cast will have you falling in love with Pawnee and the affectionate Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler). Similar in style to \"The Office,\" featuring deadpan humor from cast favorites April Ludgate (Aubrey Plaza) and Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman). If you can\u2019t get enough of Aubrey Plaza, she also stars\u00a0in the Grumpy Cat movie, \"Grump Cat's Worst Christmas Ever,\" which came out late last month. Watching this TV show will make you want to have a friendship like Leslie and Ann (Rashida Jones), make you fall in love with the opposites-attract-romance of April and Andy Dwyer (Chris Pratt), and make you want to treat yo\u2019 self like Tom Haverford (Aziz Ansari) and Donna Meagle (Retta).\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"What is better than curling up in front of the fire with hot cocoa and Netflix over winter break?

Right now, I have over 10,000 trees.\"\r\n\r\nChevallier was originally inspired to start her company by the lack of high quality olive oil in local stores.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere\u2019s no good olive oil around,\" Chevallier said.\u00a0\"About 70 percent of the oil sold here is fake oil or adulterated oil, in every shop.\"\r\n\r\nShe learned how to make extra virgin olive oil from courses and seminars offered at the University of California Davis Extension school.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey [UC Davis Extension] wanted to and have succeeded in making California the biggest olive-growing state in the U.S.,\u201d Chevallier said. \u201cI attended a lot of different workshops. Now, I belong to two councils: one up in Berkeley and one down in Paso Robles. We exchange information on what to do about different problems such as frost and fruit flies.\"\r\n\r\nCloud 9 Olive Oil is available in many local stores, including Country Sun in Palo Alto, Draeger\u2019s Market in Menlo Park and Milk Pail Market in Mountain View. However, Chevallier said she chose to sell her products in these locations simply because they are close to home.\r\n\r\n\u201cBecause the kids are in school, I needed to stick around,\u201d Chevallier said.\r\n\r\nSo far, Chevallier has limited\u00a0the growth of her\u00a0business to the Bay Area to accommodate her daughters' schooling, developing a loyal customer base in the Paly community. She sold her oil at the Holiday Boutique last Wednesday to help support Paly Sports Boosters. Her daughter Claire is now in her fourth season of Paly lacrosse.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_80175\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"380\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/IMG_1758.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-80175\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/IMG_1758.jpg\" alt=\"Claire and May Chevallier stand next to Cloud 9 Orchard's table at the Holiday Boutique.
