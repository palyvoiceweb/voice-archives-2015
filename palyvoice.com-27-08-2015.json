This is the new Tutorial, at least for now.\r\n\r\nWith the start of the 2015-16 school year, Paly administrators have instituted punitive measures for failing to attend\u00a0Tutorial, an hour-long block on T days, initially created to give students a\u00a0time to learn outside of the classroom.\r\n\r\nAccording to Principal Kim Diorio, when the bell schedule was established five years ago, Tutorial was envisioned to be a mandatory instructional time built for getting extra help, catching up on homework or talking with teachers.\r\n\r\n\u201cUnfortunately, our efforts in the beginning when we first launched Tutorial did not measure with students as originally intended,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cStudents then didn\u2019t see the value in it.\u201d\r\n\r\nLegally, however, the Western Association of Schools and Colleges and the educational code\u00a0for California\u00a0both view Tutorial as instructional time with mandatory attendance, according to Diorio. Not only is the school required to be teaching, but if a student is harmed off-campus, the school assumes responsibility.\r\n\r\nWith that, freshmen and sophomores have been assigned to their Teacher Advisor in hopes of fostering a stronger relationship between student and adult, while juniors and seniors have been assigned to a Tutorial class of approximately 12 students, Diorio said.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe want to encourage those relationships between students and their Teacher Advisors,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to build a climate of care in our campus.\u201d\r\n\r\nTutorial will provide another opportunity\u00a0for teachers\u00a0to check-in with students and let them know that the administrators and staff are here to support them, according to Diorio. If students do not sign in to their designated class, they will receive a \u201ccut\u201d and their parents will be notified. If students are found not using the time wisely, administrators will approach them, according to Diorio.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_106009\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"364\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/Screen-Shot-2015-08-23-at-8.32.19-PM.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-106009\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/Screen-Shot-2015-08-23-at-8.32.19-PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-08-23 at 8.32.19 PM\" width=\"364\" height=\"153\" \/><\/a> If students\u00a0fail to sign in to\u00a0Tutorial, they will receive an \"unknown absence\" on Infinite Campus and their parents will be notified.[\/caption]\r\n\r\n\u201cI think what\u2019s most likely to happen is having administrators, campus supervisors or counselors out at the exit-entry points at campus saying, 'Hey, where are you going,'\u201d Diorio said. \u201cWe\u2019d like for you to stay on campus.\u201d\r\n\r\nDespite the disciplinary\u00a0measures, Diorio has high hopes for the future of Tutorial, seeking to rebrand it as a \"gift of time\" to learn a new skill.\r\n\r\nStudents can complete school-related work, whether it be by meeting for a group project, completing college applications, talking to a teacher or doing homework. For those who do not have such work, Diorio seeks to create Tutorial activities that include meditation, yoga, student-guided workshops, teacher-mediated activities or speakers.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019d love to see us use that hour as a time where everyone is learning,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t need that extra hour to work \u2026 maybe this is an hour where you can do something fun, creative and learn something new. Just for the sake of learning \u2014 no grades or points attached.\u201d\r\n\r\nJunior Jackson Kienitz, who has attended Paly since his freshman year, looks forward to the additional activities provided during Tutorial.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt gives students the chance to try new things without the long-term commitment of signing up for a class,\u201d Kienitz said.\r\n\r\nAlthough there are changes to Tutorial this year, the administration is aware that every student utilizes the allotted Tutorial hour in his or her\u00a0own way.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe are trying to be really mindful in how we improve Tutorial,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cWe\u2019re calling it Tutorial 2.0.\u201d\r\n\r\nDiorio also plans to use the attendance trends to assist students who are struggling. The application \u201cTrackavike\u201d gives administration and faculty the ability to scan students into their desired Tutorial class, and thus track which\u00a0classroom each\u00a0student has signed into.\r\n\r\nAccording to Diorio, administrators will be able to see \u201cwhere kids need additional\u00a0help, what classrooms they want to go to, and \u2026 when students are struggling to see how they have been managing their time.\u201d If a student has been struggling in math but has been attending their history Tutorial, for example, counselors can immediately recognize the problem.\r\n\r\nFrom a student\u2019s perspective, some are angry\u00a0about\u00a0the change, in part\u00a0because juniors and seniors\u00a0must walk far\u00a0to check-in with an unfamiliar teacher.\r\n\r\n\"Everyone is just upset that they have to walk across campus to a random classroom,\" junior Nathaniel Hancock said.\r\n\r\nKienitz believes the issue will soon pass, as students just need time to get acquainted with\u00a0the mandatory attendance system.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think the discontent with mandatory Tutorials is a temporary problem,\u201d Kienitz said. \u201cIt\u2019s simply a matter of getting used to it.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe administration looks forward to giving students an additional hour to learn, according to Diorio.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take some time to shift that, for students to understand the value of Tutorial as we see it,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cBut we think there\u2019s value in it, or else we wouldn\u2019t have given it up as instructional time in this thing we call Tutorial.\u201d","excerpt":"With the start of the 2015-16 school year, Paly administrators have instituted punitive measures for failing to attend Tutorial, an hour-long block on T days.","date":"2015-08-25 15:01:27","author":"Adele Bloch","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/MG_8132-2.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"8458":"administration","8644":"diorio","47579":"jackson","47580":"jackson kienitz","44647":"kim","8834":"Kim Diorio","47578":"mandatory","8953":"paly","47581":"ta","47582":"teacher advisor","11060":"tutorial"}},{"id":106087,"title":"Slideshow: Annual art fair floods community with color","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/08\/25\/slideshow-annual-art-fair-floods-community-with-color\/","content":"The 34th Palo Alto Festival of the Arts submerged downtown Palo Alto in color as hundreds of California artists convened for the annual event on Saturday and Sunday.\r\n\r\nThe festival featured over 300 artists from across the state who filled University Avenue with art including ceramics, watercolor, photography and sculptures.

According to Herr, there are many available roles and auditioning actors don\u2019t have to be experienced actors.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe would like to encourage people outside of the theater department to come and see what it\u2019s like to be a part of it,\u201d Herr said.\r\n\r\nHerr and Kienitz, who both have experience producing children\u2019s shows, chose the play \u201cShrek the Musical Jr.\u201d because they wished for a show that would appeal to a broad audience.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou pick up a show that the high school kids would want to see as well as younger people,\u201d Kienitz said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tricky thing to do, to find a show that\u2019s known by high school people, adults, and to the younger kids. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do, we\u2019re going to expand it as far as we can and draw in as many audience members as we can.\u201d\r\n\r\n\"The Odyssey,\" however, was chosen after discovering a flaw with the show the department had originally chosen, according to Woods.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat was a whole other interesting journey because originally we were planning on doing \u2018Metamorphoses,\u2019 which is a retelling of Greek Myths,\u201d Woods said. \u201cBut you need a swimming pool. We realized that we\u2019re in the middle of a drought and that it was probably not the best choice.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Woods, those with musical talent who are not necessarily actors can also audition for \u201cThe Odyssey.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have a Paly graduate, Jonathan Shue, who\u2019s a professional actor and musician, and he\u2019s going to be working with students to compose music as a part of \u2018The Odyssey,\u2019\u201d Woods said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a lot of innovation around the staging piece and the music.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe directors are not the only ones excited about the upcoming fall plays. According to junior Molly Kraus, who will be auditioning for \u201cThe Odyssey,\u201d she is most excited for the people.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s always the people we\u2019re really here for in the end,\u201d Kraus said. \u201cEveryone involved in the production, whether they\u2019re on stage, behind it or watching it.\u201d\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School Theater Department is hosting auditions for its fall plays \"Shrek\" and \"The Odyssey\" at 3 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. Tuesday and Wednesday with callbacks on Thursday at the Haymarket Theatre.","date":"2015-08-24 12:03:28","author":"Ana Caklovic","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/08\/shrekandodyssey.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"47574":"auditions","47570":"august","47569":"fall play","47573":"greek mythology","29689":"kathleen woods","13035":"molly kraus","47566":"Shrek the Musical jr","47572":"tanna herr","47567":"the odyssey","9159":"theater","47568":"theatre auditions","47571":"tony kienitz"}},{"id":105975,"title":"First Friday Lunch Rally: A spirited start to the new year","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/08\/23\/first-friday-lunch-rally-a-spirited-start-to-the-new-year\/","content":"To kick off the new school year, the Palo Alto High School Associated Student Body organized\u00a0a <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/08\/20\/first-rally-of-the-year-to-feature-performances-and-relay-race\/\">lunchtime rally on Friday<\/a>, complete with a relay race and performance.\r\n\r\nJunior ASB Spirit\u00a0Commissioner Cezanne Lane was delighted with the outcome of the rally.\r\n\r\n\u201cEveryone seemed really excited about it,\u201d Lane said. \u201cI kind of think of this rally as a hint to the freshmen, like \u2018Hey, we are super into our spirit and we want you to be too!\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Paly Dance Team performed a dance choreographed by senior captains Melanie Guan and Emma Sternfield.
