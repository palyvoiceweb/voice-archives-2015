The Scorecard then provides a list of schools that includes both 2-year community colleges and 4-year universities.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the College Scorecard is to give college-bound seniors more information about prospective colleges.\r\n\r\n\u201cMy administration [the Obama Administration] will release a new \u2018College Scorecard\u2019 that parents and students can use to compare schools based on a simple criteria \u2013 where you can get the most bang for your educational buck,\u201d President Barack Obama said in his 2013 State of the Union Address.\r\n\r\nThe College Scorecard website emphasizes financial statistics for average annual cost, graduation rate and salary after attending. A user-friendly slider bar filters search results so students can determine the desired ranges for the three categories. However, though these statistics are useful, Palo Alto High School College Adviser Sandra Cernobori says most of the numbers can be found through other websites. The website does not contain data about admission statistics.\r\n\r\nThe information on Scorecard may also be potentially misleading and not representative of the Paly community, according to Cernobori.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt [the Scorecard] reports the [predicted] salary [after graduation],\u201d Cernobori said. \u201cOn the surface, people might think that it\u2019s reporting across the board, but it\u2019s only reporting for those students who received federal aid which at Paly, is a small portion of the population. \u2026 It might be a little misleading.\u201d\r\n\r\nIn general, research is essential when applying to colleges, according to Cernobori.\r\n\r\n\u201cIn my experience, students don\u2019t often do as much digging into figuring out matches as I think that they should,\u201d Cernobori said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to play a more active role in your search, don\u2019t let your college be an arranged marriage.\u201d\r\n\r\nCernobori recommends looking at colleges holistically to find a school that fits each individual student.\r\n\r\n\u201cDon\u2019t let someone else\u2019s opinion dictate your list,\u201d Cernobori said. \u201cIt\u2019s fine if you want to consult rankings, but that should be one piece of information.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Cernobori, students should know how college rankings are derived, the majors offered, rigor, academic versus social fit, culture of the campus, clubs, greek life and sports to better understand the schools.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_109525\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"566\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/Screen-Shot-2015-10-08-at-10.44.19-AM.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-109525\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/Screen-Shot-2015-10-08-at-10.44.19-AM.png\" alt=\"The College Scorecard should be supplemented with other tools, according to Cernobori.\" width=\"566\" height=\"262\" \/><\/a> The College Scorecard website is highly user-friendly.

Screenshot by\u00a0Will Zhou.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe College Scorecard should be supplemented with other tools, according to Cernobori. Two research tools that Cernobori suggests to students researching colleges are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alumnifactor.com\/\">The Alumni Factor<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/nces.ed.gov\/collegenavigator\/\">College Navigator<\/a>.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think [they] might be a little bit more representative in terms of giving you more of an idea of what salaries graduates and alumni have,\u201d Cernobori said.\r\n\r\nThe Alumni Factor is a website that ranks colleges based on what the graduates do after completing school. According to its website, the ranking considers the college experience, overall assessment, financial success, overall happiness and graduation rate as the components of its methodology.\r\n\r\nThe College Navigator website, a federally funded site run by the National Center for Education Statistics, is a search tool that includes a great variety of search options. Though significantly less visually appealing than the College Scorecard, Cernobori says College Navigator provides a powerful and comprehensive search.\r\n\r\nAnother tool that students have found valuable is Naviance because it contains college admissions statistics specific to Paly.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve looked at the scattergrams on Naviance,\u201d senior Claire Dennis said. \u201cIt\u2019s helpful to see the acceptance history since it\u2019s Paly specific. <a href=\"https:\/\/colleges.niche.com\/\">College Prowler <\/a>is also helpful since it gives you an idea of the environment [of the colleges], and you can see what appeals to you so you can make an educated decision.\u201d\r\n\r\nFor students applying to college, Dennis advises to begin looking early.\r\n\r\n\u201cStart [researching] early to get an idea of what you like, and begin narrowing down your list,\u201d Dennis said.","excerpt":"With college application deadlines approaching and the recent release of Obama\u2019s college research tool, the College Scorecard, The Paly Voice wanted to find the best tools to aid students in finding the perfect college.","date":"2015-10-15 10:55:07","author":"Emily Hwang","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/Screen-Shot-2015-10-08-at-10.44.19-AM.png\nTwo research tools that Cernobori suggests to students researching colleges are The Alumni Factor and College Navigator. \u201cI think [they] might be a little bit more representative in terms of giving you more of an idea of what salaries graduates and alumni have.\u201d Cernobori said.\" \/>","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["admission","college","essay","perfect"]},{"id":109706,"title":"Tips for taking the new PSAT","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/10\/13\/tips-for-taking-the-new-psat\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_109833\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"551\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/DSCN2175.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-109833\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/DSCN2175.jpg\" alt=\"DSCN2175\" width=\"551\" height=\"413\" \/><\/a> Junior Allison Shih studies from her PSAT practice booklet during lunch.

It contains practice problems and a thorough description of what each section entails. Reading the instructions will save you time on the test and will allow you to directly start answering the questions. Familiarize yourself with the types of questions so you won\u2019t be surprised on the actual day.<\/span><\/li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Eat healthily.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Having a nourished body will allow you to focus on questions without thinking of your hunger. Remember, the new PSAT lasts 2 hours and 45 minutes, slightly longer than the old version. Because students are not allowed to bring food into the testing center, eating a good breakfast beforehand will prevent you from feeling hungry before it is over.<\/span><\/li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Pack the night before.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Juniors are advised to wake up slightly earlier on Wednesday to report to their special testing room (posted in the Student Center and Guidance Office windows). Bring multiple #2 pencils, a student ID and an <a href=\"https:\/\/collegereadiness.collegeboard.org\/psat-nmsqt-psat-10\/taking-the-tests\/test-day-checklist\/approved-calculators\">approved\u00a0calculator<\/a>. Pack the night before to avoid rushing in the morning and being tardy, which may ban you from taking the test.<\/span><\/li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Get lots of sleep.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Sleeping well before the PSAT will ensure that you are well-rested. Don\u2019t make careless mistakes by skipping or misreading questions!<\/span><\/li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Relax.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Some students may find it useful to take a moment to meditate and regulate their breathing before the exam. Take a minute or two to forget your surroundings and envision yourself taking practice PSAT tests. Dedicating this small portion of time to relaxation can have a large payoff by improving your ability to focus.<\/span><\/li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">Pace yourself.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0Learn the number of questions per section and the time allotted. According to the <a href=\"https:\/\/collegereadiness.collegeboard.org\/psat-nmsqt-psat-10\">College Board<\/a>, the Evidence-based Reading section has 60 minutes to complete 47 questions while the Writing and Language section gives you 35 minutes for 44 questions. The Math calculator section has 31 questions long and is 45 minutes long, while the no calculator section has 25 minutes for 17 questions. With this in mind, you\u2019ll be less likely to fall behind or rush and make careless mistakes.<\/span><\/li>\r\n\t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Guess!<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Unlike the old PSAT, the new test has no guessing penalty. Take advantage of this feature to gain\u00a0some peace of mind if you encounter a question you don\u2019t know the answer to by guessing instead.<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With these tricks\u00a0up your sleeve, hopefully you will be able to perform better on the PSAT. Good luck tomorrow!<\/span>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"The Paly Voice is here to give the Class of 2017 updated information and advice on how to perform well on the new PSAT, administered tomorrow.","date":"2015-10-13 22:28:26","author":"Adrienne Kwok","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/DSCN2175.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":["advice","allison","ally","changes","do","junior","juniors","new","nmsqt","october","psat","shih","study","tips","well"]},{"id":109673,"title":"Tuesday Tunes: The iconic Bungarden","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/10\/13\/tuesday-tunes-the-iconic-bungarden\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_109674\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"501\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/final-bungarden.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-109674\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/final-bungarden.jpg\" alt=\"final bungarden\" width=\"501\" height=\"533\" \/><\/a> Advanced Placement United States History teacher John Bungarden holds a Yoda doll while in his classroom.

Ask about more than just statistics and averages.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe college fair is a great way to learn about more than a\u00a0school's numbers. You can look up scores and statistical information online in your free time. In fact, if you ask admissions counselors and alumni for basic data, you may\u00a0come across as unprepared\u00a0instead of excited about the university.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Academic life<\/span>\r\n\r\nIt's important to ask about the academic life at the school. Make sure to bring up:\r\n\r\n\u2013 Work\/life balance\r\n\r\n\u2013 Studying outside your major\r\n\r\n\u2013 Unique programs offered\r\n\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Social life<\/span>\r\n\r\nAlthough academics are important, don't forget to ask about different ways you can get socially involved and connect with students at\u00a0the school, as this will help you determine whether you like\u00a0the school's culture. Ask about:\r\n\r\n\u2013 Clubs\r\n\r\n\u2013 Greek life\r\n\r\n\u2013 Community service and volunteer hours\r\n\r\n\u2013 Events on campus\r\n\r\n\u2013 How dorms are organized: by major, by interest, or random?\r\n\r\n\u2013 Fun traditions\r\n\r\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Work\/Career opportunities<\/span>\r\n\r\nAsking about work and career\u00a0opportunities demonstrates an impressive level of interest and maturity. Make sure you talk a little about:\r\n\r\n\u2013 Undergraduate research\r\n\r\n\u2013 Studying abroad\r\n\r\n\u2013 Internships\r\n\r\n\u2013 Alumni networks\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Engage in in-depth conversations instead of\u00a0focusing on visiting\u00a0every booth.<\/strong>\r\n\r\nMake sure to converse thoughtfully with as many representatives as you can. Wait at the booth rather than just skimming aisles and picking up packets. Representatives value the time you take to talk to them and are more likely to remember you when reading applications.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. If a representative is an alumnus, ask why they chose\u00a0the school.\u00a0<\/strong>\r\n\r\nTheir answer will help you write an authentic and honest\u00a0supplement about why you want to apply to their university, which provides a personalized story and can help you decide whether to apply.\r\n\r\n<strong>4. Follow up with emails to show interest. <\/strong>\r\n\r\nA common misconception is that you'll sound needy or annoying, but a genuine thank you shows representatives that you are truly interested in their school and helps them see you as a potential student. Asking additional questions\u00a0also\u00a0ensures they won't forget you.\r\n\r\nPaly's College and Career Center has also provided a list of things to do when attending a college fair.

We also did a good job mixing up our shots, either hitting the ball or tipping the ball.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Wilson, it was junior libero Cassie Fong\u2019s first time playing in that position, who usually plays as a setter, a new dynamic for the team. Fan also praised Fong\u2019s performance.\r\n\r\n\u201cCassie really stepped up and played libero really well,\u201d Fan said. \u201cShe\u2019s never played there before.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith huge turnouts in the student sections for both schools, the crowd noise and \u201cseventh-man\u201d in the gym affected play during the game, according to junior right side hitter Katie Passarello.\r\n\r\n\u201cI thought we kind of got a little spooked by Gunn\u2019s super loud crowd during the second and third games, but we were able to come back and calm ourselves down,\u201d Passarello said. \u201cWe did a really good job in controlling our emotions at the end.\u201d\r\n\r\nLooking forward, Paly will be focusing on its fundamentals as well as the team aspects of the game, according to Green.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe definitely need to work on serve-receive because we missed a lot of balls,\u201d Green said. \u201cAlso, just communication on the court and working together.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Vikings\u2019 next game is set for 6:45 p.m. on Oct. 13, an away game against the Los Gatos Wildcats (11-7, 3-2).\r\n<div id=\"cp_widget_317536eb-85b6-47ab-b844-bc816c85904e\">\r\n<div id=\"cp_widget_6935fb39-1dd7-4dab-bd05-59d52f4f6055\">\r\n\r\n...<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\/\/ <![CDATA[\r\nvar cpo = []; cpo[\"_object\"] =\"cp_widget_6935fb39-1dd7-4dab-bd05-59d52f4f6055\"; cpo[\"_fid\"] = \"AwCAh88qOWSg\";\r\nvar _cpmp = _cpmp || []; _cpmp.push(cpo);\r\n(function() { var cp = document.createElement(\"script\"); cp.type = \"text\/javascript\";\r\ncp.async = true; cp.src = \"\/\/www.cincopa.com\/media-platform\/runtime\/libasync.js\";\r\nvar c = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0];\r\nc.parentNode.insertBefore(cp, c); })(); \r\n\/\/ ]]><\/script><noscript>Powered by Cincopa <a href='http:\/\/www.cincopa.com\/video-hosting'>Video Hosting for Business<\/a> solution.<\/noscript>\r\n\r\n\r\n","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School volleyball team (167, 4-1) earned its fourth De Anza League victory over Gunn High School (10-9, 1-4) on Thursday at Gunn in a home game for Paly, with an end score of 3-2.","date":"2015-10-11 19:18:10","author":"Emma van der Veen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/IMG_3326.jpg","categories":["Sports","Sports Recap","Spotlight","Volleyball"],"tags":["cassie fong","Chelsea Fan","claire dennis","craig benkowski","fiona green","gunn","Jekara Wilson","jessica lee","katie passarello","palo alto high school","paly","sports","titans","vikings","volleyball"]},{"id":109641,"title":"Advisory this week is for all freshmen and seniors","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/10\/11\/advisory-this-week-is-for-all-freshmen-and-seniors\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2015-10-11 15:42:27","author":"Josh Yuen","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]},{"id":109454,"title":"ASB calls Spirit Swap a success","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/10\/11\/asb-calls-spirit-swap-a-success\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_109636\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"426\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/SPIRITSWAP1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-109636\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/SPIRITSWAP1.jpg\" alt=\"SPIRITSWAP\" width=\"426\" height=\"273\" \/><\/a> Students observe the array of spirit gear at the first Spirit Swap. \u201cIn the past, I have spent a lot of money buying stuff for Spirit Week and it\u2019s been hard to borrow from other grades,\u201d junior ASB Vice-President Anmol Nagar said. \u201cThis way, Spirit Week gear is more accessible to everyone.\u201d Photo by Aidan Maese-Czeropski.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nPalo Alto High School's Associated Student Body is calling the first Spirit Swap a success after it brought new gear to students in preparation for Spirit Week.\r\n\r\nThe Spirit Swap allowed students to exchange old items used at past Spirit Weeks for new items they can use this year. Tradable objects included articles of clothing ranging from hula skirts to cowboy hats, as well as any other materials which express a class' Spirit Week theme.\r\n\r\n\"The spirit swap actually went really well,\" senior ASB School Board Representative Emma Cole said. \"By the last day, we had a lot of students participating, and I think we were successful in helping students get some pretty cool spirit week gear.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Cole, the purpose of Spirit Swap was to make Spirit Week an easier and more affordable experience.\r\n\r\n\u201cI know many students have a lot of old Spirit Week gear that may sit in the back of their closets or even get thrown away,\u201d Cole said. \u201cIt's a nice idea to pass on the gear to students who can actually use it \u2013\u00a0it saves time, energy and money spent at Goodwill or Target.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to junior ASB Vice President Anmol Nagar, Spirit Swap was a popular idea among most students.\r\n\r\n\u201cPeople definitely think of it as a great way to get spirit gear without spending a lot of money,\u201d Nagar said.\r\n\r\nAccording to Cole, Spirit Swap will most likely be implemented in future years.\r\n\r\n\"Hopefully we will be able to continue doing that [hosting Spirit Swap] with some sort of system in which students can sign out items from what we have, use them for the week, and then return them after,\" Cole said.\r\n\r\nSenior Ely Wing says that the gear swap was beneficial to students who plan on participating in Spirit Week.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was exciting being able to clear out my closet while providing cheap costumes to other students,\u201d Wing said.","excerpt":"After a successful Spirit Swap, Associated Student Body plans on making it a new tradition at Palo Alto High School.","date":"2015-10-11 11:39:03","author":"Aidan Maese-Czeropski","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/SPIRITSWAP.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["Alto","anmol","clothing","cole","ely","emma","freak yacht accident","gear","High","money","nagar","Palo","paly","School","spirit","spirit swap","Spirit Week","viking","wing"]}]
