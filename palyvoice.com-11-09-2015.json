Consequently, the school will encourage students to bring their own personal devices.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping to have students come to school next year with their own laptops, Chromebooks, tablets, or whatever it is that they want to use,\" Diorio said. \u00a0\"When they\u2019re in class they can just pull it out, work on it right there and put it back in their bag.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Diorio, the administration will not require students to bring any particular kind of device.\r\n\r\n\u201cSome schools have gone one-to-one with iPads or with Chromebooks, but we want students and their families to make the choice that works best for them,\u201d Diorio said.\r\n\r\nFor students who are unable to afford a personal device, Diorio said the school will cover the cost, although the students will still have to pay for an affordable insurance policy.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe would be using some outside funding to work on providing devices for anyone who needs it,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cWhat most schools do is have students buy an insurance policy, so that they do not have to pay for the entire cost of the device if they lose or break their device.\u201d\r\n\r\nSophomore Reetu Joshi believes that more widespread technology use will only be effective if teachers regulate it.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf the teachers don\u2019t have any rules about it [using electronics], kids will be on their laptops all the time,\u201d Joshi said. \u201cBut if they say, \u2018You can\u2019t take your laptops out unless I tell you,\u2019 it\u2019ll be better.\u201d\r\n\r\nAdvanced Placement Psychology classes have already piloted a technology program similar to the proposed BYOD policy,\u00a0in which all students are given a designated Chromebook to use throughout the school year. AP Psychology teacher Chris Farina believes that the new approach may prevent device shortages and reduce the pressure on the school to provide equipment for students.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt can help alleviate the strain on some of the resources we have in the various departments,\u201d Farina said. \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t need a laptop set of 32 ... you just need 16.\u201d\r\n\r\nFarina echoed Joshi's statement, expressing his concern\u00a0that\u00a0technology could become a distraction rather than an educational asset.\r\n\r\n\u201cFrom a classroom management perspective, the big concern for the teachers is how they\u2019re going to balance providing kids with access to the Internet,\u201d Farina said. \u201cHow do we keep them focused on doing class work in class and not on Facebook, or Instagram or Reddit or wherever else they would like to go?\u201d","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School administration is seeking to implement a bring-your-own-device policy for the 2016-17 school year to ensure every student has access to an electronic device.","date":"2015-09-08 23:06:08","author":"Dhara Yu","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/IMG_1715.jpg","categories":["News"],"tags":{"52313":"BYOD","52316":"chris farina","52314":"chromebooks","52315":"device","8644":"diorio","17796":"psych","11642":"psychology"}},{"id":107365,"title":"Friday&#8217;s Safe and Welcoming Day in numbers","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/09\/08\/fridays-safe-and-welcoming-day-in-numbers\/","content":"Over 34 percent of Palo Alto High School students were absent on\u00a0Friday for Safe and Welcoming Day, a minimum day dedicated to preparing students for emergency situations and reminding students of school protocol, according to Attendance Secretary Karla Larson.\r\n\r\nStudents who attended school on Friday are now equipped with knowledge for dealing with future potential problems, after participating in Code Red and earthquake drills and discussing the Paly handbook, the academic integrity policy and bullying on Friday.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_107366\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"295\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/photo.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-107366\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/photo.jpg\" alt=\"Some classrooms were almost empty, as large number of students were absent during on Drill Day.

The season ended with a tough loss to Homestead High School in the quarterfinals of the <span style=\"color: #000000;\">Central Coast Section<\/span>\u00a0playoffs.\r\n\r\nWilson,\u00a0who led last years JV team to a second place finish in league play, said she is excited to take over the team.\r\n\r\n\u201cBeing the head coach of this program feels like an honor and a true privilege,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cI have worked so hard to get here and couldn't be more excited about this season.\u201d\r\n\r\nWilson played for Paly volleyball as a teen, and continued to play volleyball in college at West Valley. This internal promotion is the second attempt to fill the void that was left by former volleyball coach Dave Winn, who coached Paly volleyball for eight years and led the team to two state championships.\r\n\r\nAnother challenge\u00a0the\u00a0volleyball team will face this year is the lack of a home gym. Because of construction, Paly volleyball and other sports will have to practice and play home games at Gunn High School.\r\n\r\n\u201cGunn has been wonderful in accommodating us, but there is a time issue when it comes to travel time daily to practice, especially during commuter traffic,\u201d Wilson said.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, some players feel that the extra hour it takes to travel to and from Gunn takes away from time that could be spent on homework, and adds to the already stressful life of a student athlete.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is very annoying that we have to practice at Gunn,\" \u00a0junior Jessica Lee said. \u00a0\"Not only is practice two\u00a0hours long but it also takes about a half hour to and from Gunn so that is another hour wasted by just traveling to Gunn when we could be working on homework or studying.\u201d\r\n\r\nDespite the loss of some pivotal seniors and the lack of a home gym, Wilson said she believes her current team can reestablish the vikings\u00a0as one of the best team in the league.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have a very strong chance at winning leagues this season,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cPaly went eight consecutive years winning league from 2005 - 2012, I think we can restore that status this season. Overall, I am pleased with our team's progress in practices alone and honestly believe that they can achieve anything they set their minds to.\u201d\r\n\r\nWilson hopes to achieve this \u201ccan-do\u201d attitude through the leadership of powerful senior captains Claire Krugler, Claire Dennis, and Clara Chiu. The team starts their season off at 6:15 p.m. Tuesday Sept. 8th at Del Mar High School in San Jose.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School volleyball team is preparing for its upcoming season with a new head coach as well as the loss of key seniors.","date":"2015-09-08 18:16:17","author":"Sherwin Amsbaugh","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/LRP_08191.jpg","categories":["Sports","Spotlight","Volleyball"],"tags":{"19460":"2015","32530":"anna dukovic","52186":"Chelsea Fan","8586":"claire dennis","52184":"Claire Krugler","49103":"clara chiu","8630":"dave winn","15412":"de anza","32532":"gillian chryst","9880":"jade schoenberger","52185":"Jekara Wilson","8809":"jessica lee","8944":"palo alto high school","8953":"paly","12045":"season preview","52187":"Susana Limb","9210":"vikings","9216":"volleyball"}},{"id":107351,"title":"Club Day is on Monday, Sept. 21 during lunch","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/09\/08\/club-day-is-on-monday-sept-21-during-lunch\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2015-09-08 11:25:21","author":"Josh Yuen","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":[]}]
