Although there is some comfortable indoor seating, it's in the corners of the store, so outdoor seating seems to be a better option.

It was generally too watery and the pearls were gummy, but it had an excellent flavor. Photo by Alex Merkle-Raymond.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nOn to the pearl milk tea: the tea itself had\u00a0a very strong flavor, almost to a point of bitterness. I would recommend getting a fruity-flavored drink for the extra boost of sweetness, or maybe even going up to the full 100% sweetness option. The tea's consistency was watery, thin and not creamy. My drink was still quite warm because the ice hadn't cooled the drink enough, which is one of my biggest pet peeves.\r\n\r\nThe pearls, medium-sized and chewy, were a wonderful, sweet flavor that balanced out the strength of the tea.\u00a0The consistency was gummy, and tended to stick to the roof of my mouth when I chewed on them.\r\n\r\nThe most popular teas at Teaspoon are the cremas, rose and roasted tea, according to the store manager, Amy. There are many flavors that can be difficult to find at other places like white grape oolong, hojicha and roobios. The cremas are a tea base with an organic cream whipped topping. The most popular lactose-free tea option is the Grasshopper, a lychee green tea base mixed with fresh cucumber juice, according to their website.\r\n\r\n\"<span style=\"color: #141823;\">They actually have a good variety of tea flavors and many that I've never heard of.\u00a0I think the tea flavor in their drinks is richer, and they are always really consistent.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"color: #373e4d;\">Overall I prefer it to all the other PMT places around here even though it's a bit more expensive,\" senior Ken Chen said.<\/span>","excerpt":"Staff writer Alex Merkle-Raymond comes back to the ultimate pearl milk tea challenge.
