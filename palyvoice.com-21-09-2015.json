The perpetrators reconfigured the websites so that anyone who tried to visit the site was confronted with an image\u00a0of a person wearing a Guy Fawkes mask, a symbol of the activist group Anonymous that has gained prominence over the past few years for orchestrating major online security breaches.\r\n\r\nA\u00a0message below the image explained that\u00a0\"Embarcadero Media Group (Almanac) has failed to remove content that has been harmful to the wellbeing and safety of others,\" and warned that\u00a0\u201cFailure to honor all requests to remove content will lead to the permanent shutdown of all Embarcadero Media Group Websites.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe hackers ended their message by stating\u00a0\u201cWe do not forgive, we do not forget, we are legion.\"\r\n\r\nThough the perpetrator\u00a0referred vaguely to content as the reason for their attack, the\u00a0Embarcadero Media Group\u00a0does not know the actual motive.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"color: #222222;\">\"We have no idea what article or other content precipitated this attack,\" said Bill Johnson, the company's CEO. \"There has been no recent request to remove anything. We therefore have doubts that this was the real motivation behind the hacking.\"<\/span>\r\n\r\nAccording to Lieutenant Zachary Perron of the PAPD, the attack does not seem to be part of any larger movement.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis appears to be an isolated, targeted incident against a single business [the Embarcadero Media Group],\u201d Perron\u00a0said.\r\n\r\nBecause the investigation is ongoing, Perron says that the police are unable to release additional information at this time.\r\n\r\nAccording to Johnson, other\u00a0law enforcement agencies will\u00a0become involved in the investigation.\r\n\r\n\"The FBI has primary jurisdiction,\" Johnson said. \"If the FBI were to decide to not pursue an investigation, then the multi-agency Santa Clara County cyber-crime task force would take charge.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Dong, the Information Technology department of the Embarcadero Media Group disabled the websites after the sites had been breached, taking down the graphic and message posted by the hackers.\r\n\r\nJohnson\u00a0explained\u00a0that Embarcadero Media Group had put in place measures to preserve data in the case of a website crash.\r\n\r\n\"We have robust back-up and other measures that preserved all our data and allowed us to get the websites back online,\" Johnson said.\r\n\r\nHe emphasized that the hacking was likely the work of a skilled cybercriminal.\r\n\r\n\"This attack was a very well-planned and calculated attempt to inflict maximum disruption on our operations,\" Johnson said.","excerpt":"All the news websites of the Embarcadero Media Group, including the Palo Alto Weekly, are up and running again after unknown hackers disabled access Thursday night.","date":"2015-09-19 13:25:58","author":"Sherwin Amsbaugh","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/hacking-copy.jpeg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"39560":"anonymous","54994":"bill johnson","54496":"embarcadero media","54495":"hacking","54497":"jocelyn dong","38653":"Lt.

To give students a helping hand, the Paly library provides an array of resources such as free subscriptions to The New York Times, iPad and Kindle checkouts, software downloads and access to educational online databases.\r\n\r\nHowever, many Paly students are\u00a0unaware of the multitude of convenient resources.\r\n\r\n\u201cI haven't gone to the library much in my years at Paly, so I don't know much about the library resources,\u201d junior Leah Benque said. \u201cI know that there are available Kindles and magazines, and obviously books from all different genres, but apart from that, I don't know much.\u201d\r\n\r\nRead on for a description Paly\u2019s student resources and how you can start to use them.\r\n\r\n<strong>Smart Search<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAccording to librarian Rachel Kellerman, the library is creating a new way to search all resources at once with an upcoming system called \"Smart Search.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to the Smart Search <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1gtOejbs0qVu9bT_H7kHfoa8FPGMHD0BJvKh2LoKOBz4\/edit\">informational document<\/a>, it allows students \"to conduct a simple keyword search that results in information from a wide variety of high-quality databases and e-book collections. \u00a0Books located in the student\u2019s school library will also appear in Smart Search results.\"\r\n\r\nKellerman hopes to implement Smart Search at Paly and Gunn High School in the near future.\r\n\r\n<b>New York Times<\/b>\r\n\r\nPaly offers students a full subscription to the New York Times website, according to librarian Sima Thomas. All current news and archived news is accessible for free on the library\u2019s computers and is also available on students\u2019 personal laptops and phones.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe New York Times is a nice resource because it kinda crosses over from being \u2026 helpful for academics, but also great for just personal use,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice, reliable news source.\u201d\r\n\r\nTo create a New York Times account, students will need to access a special link found on the <a href=\"http:\/\/pa.opals.pausd.org\/bin\/home\">Paly Library website<\/a>. This process can only be completed on campus computers. In addition, a group pass allows for continued access to the New York Times at home. The pass is valid for a year and can be renewed. While it is called a group pass, the login and password is unique for each student user.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_108150\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"678\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/with-arrow.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-108150\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/with-arrow.png\" alt=\"with arrow\" width=\"678\" height=\"117\" \/><\/a> To access the New York TImes, students must create an account at the library and register for a group pass at the above link.

Microsoft Office is available on every desktop and laptop computer on the Paly campus.\r\n\r\nTo download applications on their own devices, students must log in with their school email through <a href=\"https:\/\/portal.office.com\/start?sku=student\">this link<\/a>.\r\n\r\n<b>Kindles and iPads<\/b>\r\n\r\nPaly has Kindles and iPads available for checkout at the library front desk. While iPads are mostly reserved for those who wish to\u00a0listen to\u00a0an audiobook, Kindles are open for any student to enjoy.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf a student needs an audiobook and wants to listen, Overdrive has a number of [hearing] aid books you can check out,\u201d Thomas said.\r\n\r\nBooks downloaded from Overdrive can be read on personal Kindles and iPads.\r\n\r\n<b>Academic Resource Center<\/b>\r\n\r\nThe Academic Resource Center is available for any student who would like tutoring from peers. There is no cost for tutoring services, and almost any Paly student can sign up to be a tutor. In addition, students can access a large amount of\u00a0of textbooks. The ARC is located in the same building as the library and faces the 700s classrooms.\r\n\r\n<b>Overdrive and eBooks<\/b>\r\n\r\nDigital distributor Overdrive offers a wide selection of eBooks, according to Thomas.\r\n\r\n\u201cOverdrive is also a really underused resource for any student who's interested in or already enjoys reading digital books or ebooks,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cWe have what\u2019s called a digital library \u2026 it\u2019s library books but they are ebooks so you can ... download the Overdrive app onto your phone or smart device, and you can actually read the book right on your phone or smart device.\u201d\r\n\r\nStudents without a smart device can borrow the book in their browser and then download the book onto their reader.\r\n\r\nAccording to Thomas, a link on the Paly library website <a href=\"http:\/\/pausd.lib.overdrive.com\/0AB47A56-6AD2-4124-AC77-DB56397C255A\/10\/45\/en\/Default.htm\">directs to Overdrive<\/a>.

Material found in this database may be especially helpful for Advanced Placement courses.\r\n\r\n\u201cColleges and universities require students to use journals in their research, so we want every Paly student to have experience using them,\u201d Kellerman said. \u201cOne of our big goals with regards to research is to have students practice using research \u2018tools\u2019 so when they have a big assignment at Paly or in the future they will be confident and quick researchers.\u201d\r\n\r\n<b>Points of View<\/b>\r\n\r\nAccording to Kellerman, Points of View is a database that contains articles from a wide variety of perspectives. Topics include marriage equality and the legalization of drugs, to list a few.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great resource for any projects having to do with writing arguments, editorials, debates, etc.,\u201d Kellerman said.\r\n\r\n<b>Adobe Products<\/b>\r\n\r\nAdobe is a company that focuses on photography, graphical and video editing.

[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Palo Alto High School Vikings football team (1-1, 0-0) fell to the San Benito Haybalers (2-0, 0-0) by a score of 49-34 last Friday in the second game of the season, a well-fought battle that was decided by a one-sided third quarter.\r\n\r\nAccording to senior quarterback Justin Hull, the Vikings played harder and performed better this year than they did in last year's game against San Benito, in which Paly lost 33-0.\r\n\r\n\u201cLast year we just got blown out by these guys, so it was nice to see a lot of effort across the board, offense and defense,\u201d Hull said.\r\n\r\nThe Vikings started the game off on a high note when Hull connected with senior wide receiver Riley Schoeben for a touchdown\u00a0in\u00a0the first 10 minutes. Immediately afterward, junior linebacker Jamie Cullen recovered a fumble on the Vikings\u2019 1-yard line, stalling a Haybalers' drive.\r\n\r\nSan Benito came back, however, with consecutive touchdowns scored by junior fullback Hunter Nye and senior running back Kyle Cameron.\r\n\r\nAlthough Paly senior fullback Shaun Pike tied up the game at the half with a touchdown less than 11 minutes into the third quarter, San Benito scored two back-to-back touchdowns in the same quarter. The Vikings' head coach Jake Halas accredited this to the Haybalers' wishbone offense, a formation that puts heavy pressure on the opposing team's defensive players. \r\n\r\n\u201cWe had a hard time shutting down that offense,\" Halas said. \"The wishbone offense hits very hard. We had some assignments blown, we couldn\u2019t really stop them.\u201d \r\n\r\nHowever, the Vikings didn\u2019t go down without a fight. Hull found receivers in the endzone multiple times during the second half, including a one-handed catch by\u00a0senior wideout Eli Givens.\r\n\r\nUltimately, San Benito\u2019s running game proved too much for the Vikings to handle.\r\n\r\n\"It was disappointing, but there\u2019s a lot that we can learn from it,\" Pike said. \"It\u2019s a good learning experience.\"\r\n\r\nThe Vikings' next game is against the Archbishop Mitty Monarchs (2-0,0-0) at 7 p.m. this upcoming Friday in San Jose.\r\n","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School Vikings football team (1-1, 0-0) fell to the San Benito Haybalers (2-0, 0-0) by a score of 49-34 last Friday, in the second game of the season, a well-fought battle that was decided by a one-sided third quarter.\r\n","date":"2015-09-15 17:58:33","author":"Jackson Doerr","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/rsz_2img_1239.jpg","categories":["Football","Sports","Sports Recap"],"tags":[]},{"id":108023,"title":"Liveblog: Girls&#8217; volleyball takes on Woodside in home opener","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/09\/15\/liveblog-girls-volleyball-takes-on-woodside-in-home-opener\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_108028\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/photo4.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-108028\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/photo4.jpg\" alt=\"The Vikings volleyball tea huddles before their game against Gunn on Sept. 23, 2014.

Photo by Adrienne Kwok.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nAttendance will be recorded at the end of Tutorial beginning tomorrow at Palo Alto High School, according to a Schoology post by Principal Kim Diorio.\r\n\r\nThe change of sign-in time from the beginning to the end of the period comes after a <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/08\/25\/tutorial-2-0-mandatory-attendance\/\">major shift<\/a> in use of the period this year.\r\n\r\nIn the post, Diorio mentions how it is the Palo Alto High School administration\u2019s vision for Tutorial to be used as \u201c<a href=\"http:\/\/paly.net\/flextime_learning_roadmap\">Flex Time<\/a>,\u201d or time spent doing non-academic activities. This includes opportunities such as <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/09\/14\/palo-alto-high-school-hosts-first-ever-yoga-on-the-quad-during-tutorial\/\">yoga on the Quad<\/a>, socializing, reading and meditating. Students can also continue to work on academic material.\r\n\r\nThe post also says that students will check in with their Tutorial teachers from 2:45 p.m. to 2:55 p.m. A warning bell will ring at 2:45 p.m. to remind students to check in.\r\n\r\nMath teacher Charlotte Harris understands the need for a new Tutorial attendance strategy.\r\n\r\n\u201cI believe that the administration wants students on campus taking use of this time, even if it\u2019s simply bonding with other people on campus,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThey want people to stay, so it makes sense to take it [attendance] at the end [of Tutorial].\u201d\r\n\r\nStudent reactions to the change in policy are mixed.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s kind of a hassle that we have to check in at the end now, but I can see why they\u2019re deciding to do it that way,\u201d senior Rachel van Gelder said. \u201cI know there are a lot of people who try to sneak out before Tutorial is over, so this will probably stop that from happening so often.\u201d\r\n\r\nJunior Jenny Zhuge is against the new approach to attendance.\r\n\r\n\u201cI just don\u2019t like that they [administration] made Tutorial mandatory for everyone,\u201d Zhuge said. \u201cIf you need help from teachers, then you should go and get help. But if you don\u2019t, and are just going to waste your time at school anyways, then might as well go home. For some people, going home and finishing work might be more productive than staying at school.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to junior Mackenzie Ferrell, Paly administration\u2019s regulation of Tutorial will be beneficial to students in ways that are not related to school work.\r\n\r\n\u201cTutorial is a great way to get help, but if you don\u2019t need to see a teacher you should be able to do fun things, and that is just what Paly administration is trying to do,\u201d Ferrell said. \u201cIt is a good time to socialize and get to know your teachers.\u201d\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Diorio mentions in the post that students must notify the school of a pre-planned absence before leaving during Tutorial, or risk being forced to stay.\r\n\r\n\u201cIf you do need to leave campus, please have your parents contact the attendance office before Tutorial starts so you can pick up a pass to leave,\u201d Diorio said in her post. \u201cThe campus supervisors\/admin [administration] at the exits of school will ask to see the pass.\u201d","excerpt":"Attendance for Tutorial will be recorded from 2:45-2:55 p.m. to ensure that students stay for the entire length of the period starting tomorrow, according to a Schoology post by Principal Kim Diorio.","date":"2015-09-14 22:01:54","author":"Adrienne Kwok","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/DSCN03741.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"8458":"administration","53664":"attendance","39937":"change","53668":"charlotte","8644":"diorio","53665":"end of period","53667":"ferrell","53669":"harris","53672":"jenny","53666":"mackenzie","8944":"palo alto high school","8953":"paly","53671":"rachel","33850":"schoology","11060":"tutorial","53670":"van gelder","53673":"zhuge"}},{"id":107922,"title":"Paly hosts first ever &#8220;Yoga on the Quad&#8221; during Tutorial","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/09\/14\/palo-alto-high-school-hosts-first-ever-yoga-on-the-quad-during-tutorial\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_107923\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"950\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/11986473_10200509181809203_7819621335471777330_n.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-107923\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/11986473_10200509181809203_7819621335471777330_n.jpg\" alt=\"A sign advertising the new event during tutorial where students are invited to participate in a yoga class on the quad called &quot;Yoga on the Quad.&quot; Photo: &quot;Paly on the quad&quot; Facebook group. \" width=\"950\" height=\"582\" \/><\/a> A sign advertising the new event during Tutorial where students are invited to participate in a yoga class on the Quad taught by yoga instructor Lisa Haley.

I promise you will see a difference in your attitude after it\u2019s done.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Stewart, she and Lane worked with Yogaworks instructor Lisa Haley to create a class in which students are able to see the benefits of yoga. Haley will lead the session.\r\n\r\n\"There is no prior experience needed and you can wear whatever you'd like,\" Lane said.\r\n\r\nAccording to junior Yashvi Tibrewal, the class is a great opportunity because it exposes students to things they might not otherwise try.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think it\u2019s great that the school is taking the effort to organize these things on campus because it makes it easier for students to try out new things, such as yoga, that we may otherwise not end up trying at home,\" Tibrewal said. \"It\u2019s also a great use of Tutorial time for when we don\u2019t feel like doing homework.\"","excerpt":"Palo Alto High School will conduct its first ever yoga class on the Quad tomorrow during tutorial which will continue to occur every Tuesday.\r\n","date":"2015-09-14 21:37:46","author":"Aisha Chabane","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/09\/11986473_10200509181809203_7819621335471777330_n.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"8953":"paly","53648":"yoga","53647":"yogaonthequad","41238":"zen"}}]
