Photo by Emma Chiu.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nNot knowing what to write in someone else's yearbook can be stressful and even awkward. If you\u2019re ever caught staring at a blank page, tapping your pen, you are likely to be perceived as an apathetic human being. Even if you truly are indifferent, out of general consideration you should still easily be able to contrive three sentences for someone (and yes, that\u2019s three sentences <i>minimum<\/i>)! If this sounds like a daunting task, here are the solutions for the most common types of people you will have to ponder:\r\n\r\n<b>1. The kid you've talked to once this entire year<\/b>\r\n\r\nWhen someone puts you in this position, it can feel a bit unfair of them and you may think that they don\u2019t deserve your time to write a message. However, chances are that this person is probably experiencing a bit of social anxiety and he or she, more than anyone, could use a nice sign-off. It\u2019s fine to give a generic compliment to this person, as long as you genuinely feel there's truth to in it! Example: \u201cIt was super fun having English with you this year. You always have really great things to say! Hope you have a fantastic summer :)\u201d\r\n\r\n<b>2. A friend you used to be a lot closer with than you are now<\/b>\r\n\r\nWhether it was just a regular falling out or a specific awkward event, we have all lost a certain level of closeness with some friends. It\u2019s fine to write about the good times you had with this person, even if they happened a while ago. Mention attributes of his or her character that you admire or accomplishments you know they will achieve in the future. If it\u2019s someone you want to strengthen your friendship with, then <i>express that<\/i>. If it\u2019s not, then <i>don\u2019t<\/i> - the most important thing to remember in this situation is to be both friendly and honest.\r\n\r\n<b>3. A solid homie<\/b>\r\n\r\nEven if you know a person well, you can still find yourself thinking \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say!\u201d How do you make it sound detailed yet not overdone, or funny yet sincere? An easy way to start is to talk about where you first met, and then go off about favorite memories from the past year (or anything from your K-12 history if you\u2019re a senior). Try to throw in an inside joke you guys have shared, and be sure to mention <i>why<\/i> you like being friends with this person anyway. If you can\u2019t think of anything, maybe that tells you something about your friendship.\r\n\r\n<b>4. That person you want to get with ;)<\/b>\r\n\r\nAgain, it\u2019s always good to talk about how you spent time together the past year. Mention how fun he or she is to be around or how much they make you laugh. Although a list of qualities shouldn\u2019t consist of the entire message, compliments are KEY. If you\u2019re feeling adventurous, you can list a bunch of adjectives and slip in the word \u201cpretty\u201d or \u201cattractive\". They\u2019ll definitely get the picture and if they\u2019ve ever been slightly interested in you, their desire to hit you up over the summer will definitely increase. If this risk sounds daunting, keep in mind that the worst that would happen is that the person you like will\u00a0be flattered but won\u2019t reciprocate feelings. Low risk, high reward!\r\n\r\n<b>5. Your best friend to whom no amount of writing could ever do justice<\/b>\r\n\r\nFor these types of people, you wonder, \u201cWhere do I even begin?!\u201d Sometimes it might feel hard because you\u2019ve written the same thing for them over the past 10 years in birthday cards, Christmas cards and let\u2019s not forget old yearbook signings. The thing to remember about this case is that you need to let go of the expectation that this yearbook signing has to be perfect. It doesn\u2019t have to flow well. It doesn\u2019t have to be the deepest thing you\u2019ve ever written to your friend. Feel free to combine all of the advice from the last four points. Just remember that your friend knows how awesome you are and no mediocre yearbook signing is going to change their positive perception of you.","excerpt":"Not knowing what to write in someone else's yearbook can be stressful and even awkward.

Palo Alto is slightly cooler than other areas in the state, but the water supply is a finite resource. It's like a fish tank: if it\u2019s being used in one place, it is not in another.\u201d\r\n\r\n\"I think it's a really good idea to restrict water,\" freshman Rebecca Yao said. \"I try to take shorter showers and we recently changed our lawn into desert plants last summer.
