School has been taught the same for generations, and lacks many areas of passion and further projects to develop these. While the current American teaching system involves many lectures and tests\u00a0that are\u00a0not as conducive to finding and delving into one's passion as they\u00a0could be, a learning environment in which students have complete freedom to do as much or as little work as they choose does not seem right either. So, the question is, how can we find a balance?\r\n\r\nPalo Alto High School journalism adviser Esther Wojcicki pushes for blended learning, a possibly solution.\r\n\r\nWojcicki\u2019s new book \"Moonshots in Education\" and recent presentation at Paly\u2019s <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/02\/08\/paly-hosts-second-annual-tedx\/\">TEDx<\/a> talk earlier this month discuss the concept of blended learning, or a way to \u201cteach 21st century skills without lecturing to students,\u201d as she described it in a recent <a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/01\/29\/voice-qa-journalism-teacher-wojcicki-introduces-new-book\/\">interview<\/a> with The Paly Voice. Her book describes how to change the culture of the classroom and revolutionize the American school system.\r\n\r\nWe whole-heartedly agree with this style of teaching as it encourages students to take control of their own learning. The current rigid structure of some classes traps many high school students in an educational system they do not feel passionate learning in. Learning extends far beyond sitting behind a desk for 90 minutes while listening to a teacher\u00a0lecture. For certain classes, like classes in STEM subjects, it is understandable that lectures\u00a0are unavoidable \u2013 it would be pretty hard to figure out how to design and code your own website without any prior lessons. That being said, there can still be ways for learning to branch off into innovative territories.\r\n\r\nPhysics teacher Gul Eris is one of several Paly teachers who have implemented\u00a0blended learning into their class curriculums. Having introduced the new format last fall, she strays away from the traditional teaching style of class lectures and homework and instead provides lecture videos for students to watch at home and practice problems or labs to do in class.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve noticed in the past is that some students struggle to keep up with writing stuff [during class lectures] or cannot pay full attention in class,\u201d Eris said. \u201cSo, if they can do it [learn the material] on their own terms in their own time, where they can make it [the lecture video] as slow or as fast as they want it to be, they can pay better attention and take better notes and can reach a better understanding of the concepts.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe numbers speak favorably in support of her theory.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe test scores are a little bit higher compared to last year,\u201d Eris said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a lot, but [they're] still higher.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a huge challenge to fit a square peg into a round hole \u2014 and even harder to fit each person's individual learning preferences into a strict, cookie-cutter model. That's why education should be personalized with blended learning. Students are currently unmotivated to learn in school, which detracts from the overall enjoyment of school. With blended learning, however, learning is more personalized, and students will be given the opportunity to pursue their true interests. The American high school system is too factory-like and not conducive to success because interests do not exactly lie in the domain. Ultimately, we push for teachers to experiment more with blended learning in classrooms\u00a0because it allows students to take control of their learning experience.","excerpt":"While the learning environment at school is satisfactory for some, to others, it is too uniform.
