On Friday at the Mitchell Park Community Center, Palo\u00a0Alto teens and adults came together for a youth forum\u00a0to encourage\u00a0teenagers\u00a0to have open discussion in a safe environment.\r\n\r\nTeen-selected adult facilitators and students from the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/www.cityofpaloalto.org\/gov\/depts\/csd\/recreation\/teens\/leadership.aspand\">Teen Advisory Board<\/a>\u00a0and <a href=\"https:\/\/paloaltoyouthcouncil.wordpress.com\/\">Palo Alto Youth Council<\/a>\u00a0led the event, officially titled \u201cIn This Together: A Place to Share, A Place to Support, A Place to Heal.\u201d The two teen groups seek to improve the community by linking teens with\u00a0the general public through the implementation of\u00a0programs that encourage student involvement.\r\n\r\n\u201c[The] teen voice is really important,\u201d TAB and\u00a0PAYC\u00a0member Elinor Aspegren said. \u201cTeens are often told that their opinions don\u2019t matter or that they\u2019re too young to know what they\u2019re talking about. \u2026 And right now, we\u2019ve given them a space to talk about what they\u2019re feeling.\u201d\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"\/\/www.cincopa.com\/media-platform\/iframe.aspx?fid=A4LAdZsnM7_z\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\nThe event kicked off with a few introductory remarks from Aspegren,\u00a0Gunn High School junior\u00a0and master of ceremonies; Rob de Geus, Palo Alto director of community services; and Amal Aziz, youth and teen services director of The City of Palo Alto.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe must be intentional [and] authentic and show resolve in our discussion with teens as we go forward,\u201d de Geus said.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, students and adults split into their respective sessions: teen discussion circles and an adult support workshop. Students engaged in three rounds of 25-minute dialogue circles, which covered the topics of \u201cSocial Academic Pressure,\u201d \u201cGrieving, Coping and Dealing with Loss,\u201d \u201cDealing with Stress,\u201d \u201cDefeating Stigma,\u201d \u201cDealing with Depression\u201d and \u201cInclusion, Acceptance and Friendship.\u201d The dialogue circles prompted students to reflect on their own lives in order to offer suggestions for how to improve the community in the future.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt [the forum] gets the conversation going, and that doesn\u2019t happen very much in other circumstances,\u201d Gunn junior Rachel Gates said.\r\n\r\nStudent facilitator and Palo Alto High School senior Emma Chiu and adult facilitator and\u00a0Gunn Oracle adviser Kristy Blackburn led the \u201cSocial Academic Pressure\u201d dialogue circle. Students discussed where academic pressure stems from and how students and adults can change the definition of social academic pressure within Palo Alto. Ideas ranged from not limiting the number of Advanced Placement classes a student can take to counting a smaller achievement, such as winning a video game,\u00a0as a success.\r\n\r\nThe \u201cDealing with Stress\u201d group led by adult facilitator Eric Bloom, Paly\u00a0Social Studies\u00a0and school climate teacher, discussed the causes of stress, how it feels and ways to alleviate it. Some members of the group reported that\u00a0tests, relationships and the future often make them feel hot, tense and filled with nervous energy.\r\n\r\nThe dialogue circles gave students chances\u00a0to be heard and to hear others, according to de Geus.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo listen and to understand can be a very powerful thing,\u201d de Geus said.\r\n\r\nAfter each dialogue session was complete,\u00a0students and adults met during \"Empathy Hour\" to allow facilitators to summarize their discussions with the rest of the forum attendees.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that when we come back and talk about all the things said in the circles, parents and administrators will \u2026 start to realize what teens and adults want,\u201d Aspegren said.\r\n\r\nGates enjoyed the experience to both share and listen to the\u00a0teen attendee's\u00a0ideas.\r\n\r\n\u201cIt was a nice to see a lot of different people engaging with each other and hearing different perspectives from people of different parts of the community,\u201d Gates said.\r\n\r\nAccording to Aspegren, the \"In This Together\" forum is just one of many discussions that will begin to\u00a0make a strong connection\u00a0between adults and teens in the community.\r\n\r\n\u201cSome say teenagers are too young \u2026 to make decisions, but I think teenagers have the power to change the world,\u201d Gunn sophomore and TAB\u00a0member Shannon Yang said.","excerpt":"Both teens and adults came together to discuss how to improve community wellbeing and mental health in the City of Palo Alto at a youth forum on Friday at the Mitchell Park Community Center.","date":"2015-03-29 20:34:35","author":"Adele Bloch","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/IMG_8770.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":{"8611":"Community","41053":"elinor aspegren","11240":"emma chiu","11236":"eric bloom","18368":"forum","8751":"gunn","41054":"kristy blackburn","37655":"mental health","27709":"mitchell park","8939":"palo alto","8944":"palo alto high school","41052":"palo alto youth council","8953":"paly","28786":"payc","41056":"rachel gates","41057":"rob de geus","41055":"shannon yang","9107":"slideshow","9129":"student","39961":"student forum","41051":"tab","27177":"teen","33698":"teen advisory board","40993":"teen forum"}},{"id":101604,"title":"Tryouts for next year&#8217;s cheer, dance and stunt teams start at 3:45 p.m. on April 13 in Dance Studio","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/03\/29\/tryouts-for-next-years-cheer-dance-and-stunt-teams-start-at-345-p-m-on-april-13-in-dance-studio\/","content":"","excerpt":"","date":"2015-03-29 13:28:22","author":"Lizzie Chun","categories":["Ticker"],"tags":{"31304":"cheer","8626":"dance","41059":"stunt","41058":"stunts","9153":"team","41060":"teams","9188":"tryouts"}},{"id":101571,"title":"ASB Election Results 2015-16","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/03\/27\/asb-election-results-2015-16\/","content":"Voting for Palo Alto High School's Associated Student Body officers for the 2015-16 school year\u00a0has come to a close and the results\u00a0are in.

The Mitchell Park Library has also demonstrated support for this initiative through its \"Wake Up Call: The Role of Sleep and Teen Health\" panel on teen sleep, which brought doctors and educators, including Associate Superintendent Charles Young together to spread awareness of sleep deprivation in Palo Alto\u2019s youth.\r\n\r\nFollowing the recent suicides in the Palo Alto community, Gunn High School sophomore Martha Cabot and former teacher Marc Vicenti started the campaign, \"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.savethe2008.com\/\">Save the 2,008,<\/a>\"\u00a0to engage the community with its\u00a0six goals to decrease academic stress at Gunn, which includes assigning a less rigorous workload, having smaller class sizes and prohibiting cell phone use on campus.\r\n\r\nLocal professional publications like Palo Alto Online have shared anonymous stories of a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.paloaltoonline.com\/news\/2015\/02\/20\/guest-opinion-living-proof-that-we-are-all-in-this-together\" target=\"_blank\">local teenager\u2019s experience<\/a> with depression and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.paloaltoonline.com\/square\/2015\/03\/25\/paly-school-board-rep-the-sorrows-of-young-palo-altans\" target=\"_blank\">guest opinions<\/a> of individuals who feel the community is not taking the right approach to improving mental health.
