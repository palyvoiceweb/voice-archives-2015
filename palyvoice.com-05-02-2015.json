At the Jan. 28 school board meeting, an unusually large number of Gunn students came to express their opinions and reactions to the recent heartbreaking news. They advocated that changes need to reach beyond academic stress and that <a href=\"http:\/\/paloaltoonline.com\/news\/2015\/01\/28\/students-to-board-its-not-gunns-fault\" target=\"_blank\">Gunn is not the only one at fault<\/a>.

Heavily discussion and lab based, the class explores topics from\u00a0nanostructures to semiconductor technology and nanotech safety.\r\n\r\nAccording to Nanotechnology teacher Robert Cormia, the class offers the opportunity of a hands-on experience in the growing field of nanoscience, in addition to the chance to use cutting-edge technology.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis course builds on a solid science foundation in chemistry and physics and provides an introduction to the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology,\" Cormia said. \"We conduct demonstrations, experiments and a field trip to Stanford University.

It aims to reach an agreement on previously addressed\u00a0main issues to advance to root cause analysis.\r\n\r\nThe Palo Alto Unified School District Minority Achievement and Talent Development Committee, having completed four out of 10 meetings since its launch in December, is addressing the causes and the main issues regarding the gap in student academic performance.\u00a0The committee has identified several key issues of disparity and established five\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/pausd.org\/community\/Committees\/MinorityAchievementTalentDevelopment\/downloads\/MATD%20Sub%20Committee%20Member%20List.pdf\">subcommittees<\/a>, each focusing to find the causes and solutions through research in areas of data analysis, best practices, focus groups, etc.\r\n\r\nCommittee member and Palo Alto High School junior Anna Lu believes the subcommittees will allow the committee to reach closer towards sustainable long term solutions.\r\n\r\n\"So far we've mainly been focusing on defining the key issues that affect minority achievement in the districts,\" Lu said. \u00a0\"As of two weeks ago, we formed the subcommittees to address individual aspects of minority achievement in order to work towards a solution. ... Our goal is to see what is and what isn't working for the district so that we can later implement measures that we know are effective long term solutions.\"\r\n\r\nThe committee, which consists of faculty, students, parents and community members, addresses the achievement gap for students of color and lower socio-economic standing within PAUSD. This immense disparity is evident in recent standardized test results from the School Accountability Report Card and a <a href=\"http:\/\/reportcards.edtrustwest.org\/district-data?county=Santa+Clara&amp;district=Palo+Alto+Unified&amp;report_year=2011\">D+ grade in educating minorities from Education Trust-West<\/a>, an education advocacy group.\r\n\r\nThe minority students experience the gap firsthand not only in achievement, but also with expectations based on race, according to senior President of Gunn High School\u2019s Black Student Union Chantel Winston.\r\n\r\n\u201cThere are definitely different expectations we face from white students and other black students,\u201d Winston said. \u201cWhen you perform well in classes, you\u2019re too white to be black. ... But when you are with white students, you\u2019re not smart enough. ... You\u2019re too black to be white.\u201d\r\n\r\nWinston reflected on the subtle distinctions teachers and students make that contribute to the difficulty of being a minority in a school in PAUSD.\r\n\r\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s obvious that there are many subtle things that makes things a lot more difficult,\u201d Winston said. \u201cEven among black students, there\u2019s a stigma that being smart is a white trait. \u2026 Palo Alto is a great place for education, but as a minority, it\u2019s very hard to fit in.\u201d\r\n\r\nData shows these difficulties, combined with a gap in opportunity and other factors, lead to less participation in honor and Advanced Placement courses and lower scores on standardized tests from minority students.\r\n\r\nStudents of African-American or Hispanic background in PAUSD schools accounted for a total of 48 AP tests in 2014 out of 3364 AP tests, according to the <a href=\"http:\/\/pausd.org\/community\/board\/downloads\/brd_packet\/item_014.pdf\">High School Measures Report released by PAUSD<\/a>.\r\n\r\n<iframe style=\"overflow-y: hidden;\" src=\"https:\/\/magic.piktochart.com\/embed\/4357275-number-of-ap-tests-by-race\" width=\"600\" height=\"401\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\nA key root of the disparity in achievement among students is their financial and family statuses, according to committee member and Palo Alto High School Principal Kim Diorio. Students in the district face vastly diverse situations, and some can be deprived of opportunities because of the environment they were born into.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have students who aren\u2019t able to do their homework because when they go home, they have to provide care for their siblings, or maybe they\u2019re working part time jobs, or maybe they don\u2019t have an adult in their family who can help them with their homework,\u201d Diorio said. \u201c[Meanwhile,] we have other students who have college-educated parents who can help them or hire a tutor to work with them.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis inequality couples with the tendency of students to compare themselves with others, which consequently can lower their sense of self-worth, according to committee member and Paly college advisor Sandra Cernobori.\r\n\r\n\u201cI meet with students who are very strong students [but] do not necessarily feel proud of their accomplishments,\u201d Cernobori said. \u201cThey\u2019re comparing them either to other people or [to] some other standard, and they don\u2019t necessarily feel confident or successful. That happens across ethnicity and race, and I am concerned especially for underserved students.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs Terman Middle School Principal Pier Angeli La Place noted at a committee meeting, it is important to start encouraging all students to strive for academic excellence at a young age, as the achievement gap is not an issue relevant only to high schools. The transition between elementary to middle and middle to high school should be smooth in order to ensure a positive academic experience.\r\n\r\n\u201cI think the best way for us to foster academic excellence is by encouraging everyone to join extra-curricular activities,\u201d Lu said. \u201cStudents have to feel included and encouraged in order to succeed.\u201d\r\n\r\nCommittee member and Gunn sophomore Shannon Yang believes the committee can start by reducing the stigma around taking certain lanes. According to Diorio, the expansion of Paly\u2019s Advancement Via Individual Determination, or AVID, program is already in the works.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe school administration wants to use AVID as a vehicle to build the program and go that way [to improve the learning environment in schools], which I think is a fine way to go,\u201d Cernobori said. \u201cI think we want to see what happens with AVID first before trying something else.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhile working to close the achievement gap, the administration remains considerate of the entire student body.\r\n\r\n\u201cSome people are concerned that higher achieving classes will be dummied down,\u201d Diorio said. \u201cI think we really need to make sure every student feels challenged in the classes, which is not easy to do. We are willing to learn from professionals and other schools who do this well.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe next committee meeting will be held from 7 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. tonight at the PAUSD Office and is open to the public.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto Unified School District Minority Achievement and Talent Development Committee will meet at 7 p.m. tonight at the PAUSD Office with the goal to reach an agreement on the addressed main issues in order to move to root cause analysis.","date":"2015-02-03 15:38:03","author":"Takaaki Sagawa","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/unnamed2.jpg","categories":["Editor's Pick","News"],"tags":{"38291":"achievement gap","38292":"glenn mcgee","38293":"pausd minority achievement and talent development committee"}},{"id":97495,"title":"Voice&#8217;s top 10 Super Bowl commercials","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/02\/03\/voices-top-10-super-bowl-commercials\/","content":"&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_97549\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"431\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/150201-roman-numerals.jpg\"><img class=\" wp-image-97549\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/150201-roman-numerals.jpg\" alt=\"Fans gather around XLIX roman numerals for the XLIX Super Bowl in Arizona.

In light of this Superbowl-ad excitement, here are our top ten ad choices for the 2015\u00a0Super Bowl:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n10. Doritos\r\n\r\nThis commercial featuring a hilarious pig and a determined boy flies into our tenth place. While we might not personally go to such extreme measures for chips as the boy did, we do appreciate the humor, and overall, we liked the ad.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/oHZW6aADnMU\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\n9. X-Finity\r\n\r\nThis commercial made us smile after a <em>ruff<\/em>\u00a0day. \u00a0We\u2019re suckers for any commercial featuring a walking dog and this was not a letdown. We don\u2019t know if we need X-finity; however, we do know that we need to introduce more dogs into the workforce.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/YR0OmZKwUIU\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\n8. T-Mobile\r\n\r\nWe sympathize with the poor folks who were not able to see Kim Kardashian's stellar outfits due to their lack of data, and we therefore had to put this hilarious commercial in eighth\u00a0place. It was a nice surprise to see Kardashian make fun of herself for a change.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/WzQ6a2UKlGM\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\n7. McDonald's\r\n\r\nThis ad brought smiles to our faces. We loved the message of happiness and giving and hope that McDonald's continues with the campaign.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/iq2Sm2XGv_s\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\n6. Dodge\r\n\r\nDuring Dodge's 100th birthday-themed commercial, we definitely took the elders' lovely advice to heart. It was a beautifully made video and made us bigger fans of Dodge.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/wpRvMT9aUb0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\n5. T-Mobile\r\n\r\nThis commercial included two of the funniest women on TV: Sarah Silverman and Chelsea Handler. Their extravagant portrayals of stereotypical celebrities had us falling off our not-so-fancy chairs.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/SPFduidJGjU\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\n4. Avocados from Mexico\r\n\r\nThis commercial made us want to avoca<em>GO<\/em>\u00a0and eat some avocados. In the \"first draft ever\" \u00a0we definitely believe that Mexico had made the right choice in picking avocados, but we wish that the United States had picked them first.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/JF02QdpPJlk\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\n3. Skittles\r\n\r\nWe were taken aback by the color of the Skittle fought over in this commercial, but we would have definitely fought over red Skittles the \"usual way.\" \u00a0We especially loved the baby\u2019s enormous muscles.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/JDwRN2GBUj8\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\n2. Snickers\r\n\r\nJust like Marsha in this Snickers ad, when we are hungry we feel hostile like Danny Trejo. We are not sure if the relationship between Tom Brady and Marsha Brady was intended but we love it anyways.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/rqbomTIWCZ8\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe>\r\n\r\n1. Nationwide\r\n\r\nThis commercial received a lot of hype, as Nationwide released a teaser for the advertisement weeks beforehand. As fans of Mindy Kaling, we were excited to see her in a funny and very Mindy Kaling-esque video. It deserved the top ranking due to its hilarity and wit.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Yrq8ruhmCX0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\"
