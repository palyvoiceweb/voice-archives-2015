Illustration by Portia Barrientos.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nIn an effort to get more high schoolers to participate in politics, a civic education project is offering an essay and a cartoon contest from which students can win prizes. \r\n\r\nLegischool, a civic education project that is working with California State University, Sacramento on this project, will award a round trip to Sacramento to meet and talk with state legislators to the winner of the essay contest and prize money to the winner of the cartoon contest.  According to LegiSchool Project Director Terre Thorne, the contests' goal is to get more teens involved with government policies.\r\n\r\n\"LegiSchool\u2019s mission is to engage high school students in matters of public policy and state government,\" Thorne said. \"One of the ways we hope to achieve that goal is through our contests, which we created to get students thinking critically about important issues. Our hope is that participation in our contests will make government relevant to young people and inspire an interest in civic life.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to the LegiSchool Project website, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.csus.edu\/calst\/LegiSchool_contests\/2015EssayFlyer.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">essay contest<\/a> requires students to write about their opinions on issues regarding low voter turnout among youth. The competition is available to all juniors and seniors in California.\r\n\r\nThe top 10 students will win a trip to Sacramento and get the chance to meet state legislators and share their ideas with them. \r\n\r\nAccording to Thorne, participants in the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.csus.edu\/calst\/LegiSchool_contests\/2015_Art_Contest.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">cartoon contest<\/a> must write an original political cartoon about a current political issue. All high schoolers can participate and students can only write one cartoon. The student who draws the most creative cartoon will win $150 and the next four runner-ups will win $100 each. The top five cartoons will also be showcased on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.kqed.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">KQED.org<\/a>.\r\n\r\nThe deadline for the essay competition is Nov. 18 and the deadline for the cartoon contest is Dec. 4.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;","excerpt":"In an effort to get more high schoolers to participate in politics,  a civic education project is offering an essay and a cartoon contest from which students can win prizes.

Afraid of hitting bikers or getting run over? The City of Palo Alto plans to implement improvements to its city roads, some of which will affect Palo Alto High School student commuters.<\/span>\r\n\r\nIn a community meeting on October 22, Palo Alto's transportation committee discussed<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0multiple changes in an effort to help Paly students have better access to the school campus from the west, east and south side,\u00a0according to Joshuah Mello, the Palo Alto Chief Transportation Official.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two concept plans to this project. Phase One Concept Plan involves El Camino Real and the Caltrain crossing on Churchill Avenue, while the Phase Two Concept Plan focuses on Churchill Avenue between Bryant Street and the Caltrain tracks. City Council approved Phase One Concept Plans earlier this year while the second phase is still being developed, according to Mello.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n\u201cWe hope to conclude the concept planning stage for Phase Two quickly, so it can join Phase One in the final design stage,\u201d Mello said. \u201cOur goal is to begin construction within the next two years.\u201d\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_111267\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"344\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/Screen-Shot-2015-11-02-at-5.11.05-PM.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-111267\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/Screen-Shot-2015-11-02-at-5.11.05-PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-11-02 at 5.11.05 PM\" width=\"344\" height=\"222\" \/><\/a> An extended bike path and new plants are approved additions to the Madrono and Castilleja sidewalk and bike path. Image courtesy of the City of Palo Alto website.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nPhase One aims to improve commuters' safety. According to Mello, some of the changes that will soon be implemented include an extension of the multi-use path to El Camino Real and Stanford Perimeter Trail, an addition to a new westbound right-turn lane, El Camino Real signal improvements, a new crosswalk on the north leg, lighting improvements and a new rapid flashing beacon. The adopted concept plan also includes a raised crosswalk on Churchill Avenue at both Madrono Avenue and Castilleja Avenue.\r\n\r\n\u201cRaised crosswalks slow motorists as they approach and encourage them to yield to crossing pedestrians at a higher rate,\u201d Mello said. \u201cThey offer tremendous safety benefits for pedestrians crossing the street at uncontrolled locations.\u201d\r\n\r\nFollowing the implementation of Phase One Concept plans,\u00a0Phase Two's proposed changes at the Alma Street and Churchill Avenue intersection include widening crosswalks, replacing the crossing surface with concrete and installing new lighting, according to\u00a0Senior Transportation Planner Sarah Syed.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_111259\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"386\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/Screen-Shot-2015-11-02-at-4.59.27-PM.png\"><img class=\"wp-image-111259\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/Screen-Shot-2015-11-02-at-4.59.27-PM.png\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2015-11-02 at 4.59.27 PM\" width=\"386\" height=\"216\" \/><\/a> The Churchill and Alma intersection is a popular crossing for many Paly students. Approximately 350 student bicyclists cross the intersection each morning, according to Senior Transportation Planner Sarah Syed.\u00a0Image courtesy of the City of Palo Alto website.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nPhase Two seeks to accommodate the approximate 350 student bicyclists and 50 pedestrians who pass the Alma and Churchill intersection between the peak morning hours of 7:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m., as well as the after school rush.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have, in a one-hour period, 300 to 400 students traveling westbound on Churchill to get to school,\u201d Syed said. \u201cIn concentrated high volume demand, the afternoon situation is more challenging.\u201d\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Students who commute through the intersection expressed concern about their safety and voiced their support for changes.<\/span>\r\n\r\n\"When you're in the front, it's not unusual to feel a little wary of the cars whizzing by you and the mob of packed students right behind you,\" junior Jerry Hong said. \"I'm glad to see that the city is trying to solve the issue and that it cares about the well-being of the students as we commute to and from school.\"\r\n\r\nThese\u00a0projects originated with the adoption of the \"Palo Alto Bicycle &amp; Pedestrian Transportation Plan\" by the City Council in 2012, according to Mello. The initial plan\u2019s goal was to expand bicycle and pedestrian commuting trips and to promote healthy lifestyles by creating bicycle-friendly infrastructure, according to the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cityofpaloalto.org\/news\/displaynews.asp?NewsID=499&amp;TargetID=107\">City of Palo Alto Website<\/a>. These recent plans are an extension of the 2012 plan.\r\n\r\nImplementing these plans are not easy and will create some complications, according to Mello.\r\n\r\n\u201cSome challenges that we are facing is preserving as much of the improved landscaping on the Paly property as possible, working effectively with Caltrain and the California Public Utilities Commission on the railroad crossing improvements and reaching consensus with the community on any proposed modifications to on-street parking or travel lane width,\u201d Mello said.\r\n\r\nMello encourages any students who are interested in helping develop the concept plans to contact him at <a href=\"mailto:Joshuah.Mello@cityofpaloalto.org\">Joshuah.Mello@cityofpaloalto.org<\/a>.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe will be more than happy to review the initial concept plans with any interested students and incorporate their feedback into the design,\u201d Mello said. \u201cI also hope that students will help get the word out and notify anyone that they know who may be interested in this project, including their parents or neighbors. The more we hear from the public, the better the final design will be.\u201d","excerpt":"Frustrated by early morning traffic? Afraid of hitting bikers or getting run over?

Photo by Cooper Lou.[\/caption]\r\n\r\nThe Palo Alto High School football team (4-5, 3-2) blew out the Homestead Mustangs (3-5, 1-3) on Friday for Senior Night, the Vikings last home game of the season, 45-7. With the win, the Vikings clinched a spot in the Central Coast Section playoffs, as the top four teams in the De Anza League are guaranteed a spot.\r\n\r\nAccording to head coach Jake Halas, controlling the ball was the deciding factor in this game.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe were able to control the ball, run the rock,\u201d Halas said. \u201cWe take our chances. We\u2019ve got Eli [Givens] and we can throw some deep balls to him too.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe game began with a strong kick-off return play, with senior wide receiver Eli Givens running the ball all the way into the end zone for a touchdown for the second consecutive game, the last against Los Gatos High School.\r\n\r\n\u201cI said I was going to take it to the house one more time on the very first play,\u201d Givens said. \u201cThey kicked it to me and I was very surprised because I thought they would\u2019ve seen Los Gatos [High School], but I guess they didn\u2019t. I just took it to the house.\u201d\r\n\r\nKick-off return plays and special teams have been a focus for the Vikings in recent weeks, according to Halas.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe improved our kick return game,\u201d Halas said. \u201cWe\u2019ve actually spent more time on our special teams lately too. The goal of any good team around here is to get better every game.\u201d\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Halas recognized the Vikings\u2019 improvement and the players becoming more comfortable and on point in each job, making the team more cohesive as a whole.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe made some adjustments in practices and we got guys in the right spot,\u201d Halas said. \u201cEarlier in the year, we had guys running through the wrong gaps and wide open gaps. We fixed and have been tweaking that.\u201d\r\n\r\nAccording to Homestead head coach Milo Lewis, the Mustangs didn\u2019t exhibit their skills strongly, but still have hopes for advancing to the Central Coast Section playoffs, as the Vikings will most likely do.\r\n\r\n\u201cThat\u2019s not our best performance,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cWe\u2019re a lot better than we just showed. We\u2019ve got two games left. We\u2019ve got to try to get one of the two, Milpitas [High School] or Los Gatos.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe game opened with the traditional ceremonies of Senior Night, recognizing the team\u2019s seniors and their families. Friday night's win was meaningful, according to Givens, especially given losses on Senior Night in the last two seasons.\r\n\r\n\u201cWatching these games for Senior Night and seeing a loss makes you just feel hopeless,\u201d Givens said. \u201cYou come back to the locker room and you see all the seniors crying, but there\u2019s nothing you can really do about it. I\u2019d seen that and I didn\u2019t want that happening to me.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Vikings have one more game in the regular season against Wilcox (6-2, 2-2). The Vikings will be focusing on recovering and preparing for Wilcox\u2019s physical offensive game, according to Halas.\r\n\r\n\u201cThey match up well,\u201d Halas said. \u201cThey\u2019re very physical up front. It\u2019s going to be a very good game. [The veer] is their offensive scheme. It\u2019s a hard-hitting, physical style of offense. They run it really well and they\u2019ve been running it for years.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Vikings\u2019 determination and work rate brings them success, according to senior running back Takeru Nishi.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe worked the whole week and it really paid off,\u201d Nishi said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get to the playoffs last year and we just really wanted to get there this year.\u201d\r\n\r\nPaly will take on the Wilcox Chargers at 7 p.m. on Nov. 13 at Wilcox High School, its last game of the regular season. The Vikings will be looking for redemption, as they lost to the Chargers last season with a score of 20-19.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto High School football team blew out the Homestead Mustangs on Friday for Senior Night, clinching a spot in the Central Coast Section playoffs.","date":"2015-11-01 11:48:02","author":"Emma van der Veen","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/I9P8242.jpg","categories":["Football","Sports","Sports Recap","Spotlight"],"tags":["eli givens","football","halas","homestead","palo alto high school","Senior Night","takeru nishi"]},{"id":111082,"title":"Liveblog: Football vs. Homestead for Senior Night","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/10\/30\/liveblog-football-vs-homestead-for-senior-night\/","content":"[liveblog]","excerpt":"Tune in to the Paly Voice liveblog of the Palo Alto Vikings' last home game of the regular season against Homestead on Senior Night.","date":"2015-10-30 19:25:11","author":"Jackson Doerr","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/I9P6770.jpg","categories":["Uncategorized"],"tags":[]},{"id":110988,"title":"School Board discusses achievement gap solutions","permalink":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/2015\/10\/29\/school-board-discusses-achievement-gap-solutions\/","content":"[caption id=\"attachment_111035\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"600\"]<a href=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/IMG_4144.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-111035 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/IMG_4144.jpg\" alt=\"Board Meeting 10\/27 Melissa Caswell\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" \/><\/a> School board president Melissa Caswell speaks at the Palo Alto Board of Education meeting on Oct. 27.

The data points revealed that historically underrepresented racial group students at Palo Alto high schools score significantly lower than those of Caucasian or Asian ethnicity.\r\n\r\n\u201cIncreasing achievement for underrepresented minorities is a high priority,\u201d board member Ken Dauber said. \u201cBut we need to do more, including improving how well curriculum and teaching meets the needs of all students and examining how well laning is supporting students in increasing achievement.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe Minority Achievement and Talent Development committee, created earlier this year, is working with elementary schools to combat the issues of struggling students as early as kindergarten and first grade. MATD is providing increased access to support resources for students and their parents, according to Judy Argumedo, the PAUSD director of Academic Supports\r\n\r\nIn\u00a0addition to establishing\u00a0the MATD committee, the school board members also implemented early literacy and math after school programs for non-native English speakers at the Hoover and Fairmeadow elementary schools in order to help students catch up at an early age.\r\n\r\n\u201cI\u2019ve talked to a lot of historically underrepresented racial group parents whose kids are struggling in math,\" school board president Melissa Caswell said. \"I believe that if you wait until middle school, you\u2019ll never be able to catch up.\"\r\n\r\nThe board members also discussed the necessity of changing the overall climate surrounding Advanced Placement courses. The board emphasized the importance of encouraging all students to take advanced classes and providing them with access to a more rich education through these courses.\r\n\r\n\u201cSome kids in our district may feel intimidated by the APs, thinking that they are only for a select group,\u201d board member Camille Townsend said. \u201cThis should become a continual focus that our that kids take at least one AP class, so they gain confidence in themselves.\u201d\r\n\r\nCaswell emphasized that the board will be focusing on improving the quality of education across all the schools within the district.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe need to ask [ourselves], \u2018Are we providing advanced topics to enough of our kids?\u2019\u201d Caswell said.","excerpt":"The Palo Alto Unified School District Board of Education plans to take action to improve school climate and decrease the achievement gap of historically underrepresented racial groups within the school district.\r\n","date":"2015-10-29 21:44:38","author":"Sherwin Amsbaugh","thumbnail":"http:\/\/palyvoice.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/10\/IMG_4144.jpg","categories":["News","Spotlight"],"tags":["achievement gap","ACT","AP testing","Camille Townsend","ken dauber","Melissa Caswell","sat"]}]
